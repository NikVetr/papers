However, state-of-the-art Bayesian methods for inferring timetrees are computationally limited to small datasets and cannot exploit the growing number of available genomes4. In the case of mammals, molecular-clock analyses of limited datasets have produced conflicting estimates of clade ages with large uncertainties5,6, and thus the timescale of placental mammal evolution remains contentious7\textendash 10. Here we develop a Bayesian molecular-clock dating approach to estimate a timetree of 4,705 mammal species integrating information from 72 mammal genomes. We show that increasingly larger phylogenomic datasets produce diversification time estimates with progressively smaller uncertainties, facilitating precise tests of macroevolutionary hypotheses. For example, we confidently reject an explosive model of placental mammal origination in the Palaeogene8 and show that crown Placentalia originated in the Late Cretaceous with unambiguous ordinal diversification in the Palaeocene/Eocene. Our Bayesian methodology facilitates analysis of complete genomes and thousands of species within an integrated framework, making it possible to address hitherto intractable research questions on species diversifications. This approach can be used to address other contentious cases of animal and plant diversifications that require analysis of species-level phylogenomic datasets.},

Using linear mixed effects meta-regression, we detect specific time patterns and regulatory modulators of the exercise response. Acute and long-term responses are transcriptionally distinct and we identify SMAD3 as a central regulator of the exercise response. Exercise induces a more pronounced inflammatory response in skeletal muscle of older individuals and our models reveal multiple sex-associated responses. We validate seven of our top genes in a separate human cohort. In this work, we provide a powerful resource (www.extrameta.org) that expands the transcriptional landscape of exercise adaptation by extending previously known responses and their regulatory networks, and identifying novel modality-, time-, age-, and sex-associated changes.},

The patient and his excreta smelled of garlic, ammonium carbide and decaying fish, which is characteristic of this poisoning. In spite of intensive care support the patient died in cardiac and respiratory failure 17 hours after ingestion of the pellets. Treatment is supportive.

  abstract = {The G-matrix summarizes the inheritance of multiple, phenotypic traits. The stability and evolution of this matrix are important issues because they affect our ability to predict how the phenotypic traits evolve by selection and drift. Despite the centrality of these issues, comparative, experimental, and analytical approaches to understanding the stability and evolution of the G-matrix have met with limited success. Nevertheless, empirical studies often find that certain structural features of the matrix are remarkably constant, suggesting that persistent selection regimes or other factors promote stability. On the theoretical side, no one has been able to derive equations that would relate stability of the G-matrix to selection regimes, population size, migration, or to the details of genetic architecture. Recent simulation studies of evolving G-matrices offer solutions to some of these problems, as well as a deeper, synthetic understanding of both the G-matrix and adaptive radiations.}

However, given the large number of environmental stimuli and power challenges for gene-by-environment testing, it remains a critical challenge to identify and prioritize specific disease-relevant environmental exposures. We propose a framework for leveraging signals from transcriptional responses to environmental perturbations to identify disease-relevant perturbations that can modulate genetic risk for complex traits and inform the functions of genetic variants associated with complex traits. We perturbed human skeletal-muscle-, fat-, and liver-relevant cell lines with 21 perturbations affecting insulin resistance, glucose homeostasis, and metabolic regulation in humans and identified thousands of environmentally responsive genes. By combining these data with GWASs from 31 distinct polygenic traits, we show that the heritability of multiple traits is enriched in regions surrounding genes responsive to specific perturbations and, further, that environmentally responsive genes are enriched for associations with specific diseases and phenotypes from the GWAS Catalog. Overall, we demonstrate the advantages of large-scale characterization of transcriptional changes in diversely stimulated and pathologically relevant cells to identify disease-relevant~perturbations.},

We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+ phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations are tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes.},

To test for empathically motivated pro-social behavior in rodents, we placed a free rat in an arena with a cagemate trapped in a restrainer. After several sessions, the free rat learned to intentionally and quickly open the restrainer and free the cagemate. Rats did not open empty or object-containing restrainers. They freed cagemates even when social contact was prevented. When liberating a cagemate was pitted against chocolate contained within a second restrainer, rats opened both restrainers and typically shared the chocolate. Thus, rats behave pro-socially in response to a conspecific's distress, providing strong evidence for biological roots of empathically motivated helping behavior.},

Although these models have proved useful in a variety of contexts, they still do not cover all the scenarios biologists want to examine. For models based on the OU process, model complexity is restricted in current implementations by assuming that the rate of stochastic motion and the strength of selection do not vary among selective regimes. Here, we expand the OU model of adaptive evolution to include models that variously relax the assumption of a constant rate and strength of selection. In its most general form, the methods described here can assign each selective regime a separate trait optimum, a rate of stochastic motion parameter, and a parameter for the strength of selection. We use simulations to show that our models can detect meaningful differences in the evolutionary process, especially with larger sample sizes. We also illustrate our method using an empirical example of genome size evolution within a large flowering plant clade.},

  abstract = {Individuals differ in the way they judge ambiguous information: some individuals interpret ambiguous information in a more optimistic, and others in a more pessimistic way. Over the past two decades, such "optimistic" and "pessimistic" cognitive judgment biases (CJBs) have been utilized in animal welfare science as indicators of animals' emotional states. However, empirical studies on their ecological and evolutionary relevance are still lacking. We, therefore, aimed at transferring the concept of "optimism" and "pessimism" to behavioral ecology and investigated the role of genetic and environmental factors in modulating CJB in mice. In addition, we assessed the temporal stability of individual differences in CJB. We show that the chosen genotypes (C57BL/6J and B6D2F1N) and environments ("scarce" and "complex") did not have a statistically significant influence on the responses in the CJB test. By contrast, they influenced anxiety-like behavior with C57BL/6J mice and mice from the "complex" environment displaying less anxiety-like behavior than B6D2F1N mice and mice from the "scarce" environment. As the selected genotypes and environments did not explain the existing differences in CJB, future studies might investigate the impact of other genotypes and environmental conditions on CJB, and additionally, elucidate the role of other potential causes like endocrine profiles and epigenetic modifications. Furthermore, we show that individual differences in CJB were repeatable over a period of seven weeks, suggesting that CJB represents a temporally stable trait in laboratory mice. Therefore, we encourage the further study of CJB within an animal personality framework.},

  abstract = {Recently developed methods for the scientific assessment of animal welfare can be applied to pest species when considering management procedures. Vertebrate pests include mammals, birds and some fish. The management activities which may affect the welfare of the pest animals include: killing by various means, restraining in traps, translocating, excluding from an area, scaring, using a repellent, withdrawing resources, changing physiologically, marking for population monitoring purposes and providing an alternative resource. When an animal dies, welfare ceases and if consciousness is lost instantly and not regained before death, there is no welfare problem. However, when an animal dies slowly after being shot, trapped or poisoned in a way which causes pain, fear or distress, its welfare is very poor. Most infection with disease also has severe effects. Restraining traps may cause little ill effect but some, e.g. leghold traps, may cause pain and fear to the point where self-mutilation occurs. Some poor welfare may result from translocation, physical exclusion, marking and changing physiologically. In each case it should be assessed. An estimate of the magnitude of the problem for the animal is the area under the curve when the level of the poor welfare is plotted against its duration. Human attitudes to pests are often different from attitudes to other species but if we interact with these animals we have moral obligations towards them and we should consider their welfare in every management operation. Traps, poisons and other pest control methods should be licensed for use only if scientific studies of their effects on the welfare of target and some non-target species have been carried out. The results of such studies should be publicly accessible. Cost-benefit analysis is useful in pest control but some methods which result in very poor welfare should be banned in all circumstances.},

  abstract = {Accurate taxonomy is central to the study of biological diversity, as it provides the needed evolutionary framework for taxon sampling and interpreting results. While the number of recognized species in the class Mammalia has increased through time, tabulation of those increases has relied on the sporadic release of revisionary compendia like the Mammal Species of the World (MSW) series. Here, we present the Mammal Diversity Database (MDD), a digital, publically accessible, and updateable list of all mammalian species, now available online: https://mammaldiversity.org. The MDD will continue to be updated as manuscripts describing new species and higher taxonomic changes are released. Starting from the baseline of the 3rd edition of MSW (MSW3), we performed a review of taxonomic changes published since 2004 and digitally linked species names to their original descriptions and subsequent revisionary articles in an interactive, hierarchical database. We found 6,495 species of currently recognized mammals (96 recently extinct, 6,399 extant), compared to 5,416 in MSW3 (75 extinct, 5,341 extant)\textemdash an increase of 1,079 species in about 13 years, including 11 species newly described as having gone extinct in the last 500 years. We tabulate 1,251 new species recognitions, at least 172 unions, and multiple major, higher-level changes, including an additional 88 genera (1,314 now, compared to 1,226 in MSW3) and 14 newly recognized families (167 compared to 153). Analyses of the description of new species through time and across biogeographic regions show a long-term global rate of \textasciitilde 25 species recognized per year, with the Neotropics as the overall most species-dense biogeographic region for mammals, followed closely by the Afrotropics. The MDD provides the mammalogical community with an updateable online database of taxonomic changes, joining digital efforts already established for amphibians (AmphibiaWeb, AMNH's Amphibian Species of the World), birds (e.g., Avibase, IOC World Bird List, HBW Alive), non-avian reptiles (The Reptile Database), and fish (e.g., FishBase, Catalog of Fishes).Una taxonom\'ia que precisamente refleje la realidad biol\'ogica es fundamental para el estudio de la diversidad de la vida, ya que proporciona el armaz\'on evolutivo necesario para el muestreo de taxones e interpretaci\'on de resultados del mismo. Si bien el n\'umero de especies reconocidas en la clase Mammalia ha aumentado con el tiempo, la tabulaci\'on de esos aumentos se ha basado en las espor\'adicas publicaciones de compendios de revisiones taxon\'omicas, tales como la serie Especies de mam\'iferos del mundo (MSW por sus siglas en ingl\'es). En este trabajo presentamos la Base de Datos de Diversidad de Mam\'iferos (MDD por sus siglas en ingl\'es): una lista digital de todas las especies de mam\'iferos, actualizable y accesible p\'ublicamente, disponible en la direcci\'on URL https://mammaldiversity.org/. El MDD se actualizar\'a con regularidad a medida que se publiquen art\'iculos que describan nuevas especies o que introduzcan cambios de diferentes categor\'ias taxon\'omicas. Con la tercera edici\'on de MSW (MSW3) como punto de partida, realizamos una revisi\'on en profundidad de los cambios taxon\'omicos publicados a partir del 2004. Los nombres de las especies nuevamente descriptas (o ascendidas a partir de subespecies) fueron conectadas digitalmente en una base de datos interactiva y jer\'arquica con sus descripciones originales y con art\'iculos de revisi\'on posteriores. Los datos indican que existen actualmente 6,495 especies de mam\'iferos (96 extintas, 6,399 vivientes), en comparaci\'on con las 5,416 reconocidas en MSW3 (75 extintas, 5,341 vivientes): un aumento de 1,079 especies en aproximadamente 13 a\~nos, incluyendo 11 nuevas especies consideradas extintas en los \'ultimos 500 a\~nos. Se\~nalamos 1,251 nuevos reconocimientos de especies, al menos 172 uniones y varios cambios a mayor nivel taxon\'omico, incluyendo 88 g\'eneros adicionales (1,314 reconocidos, comparados con 1,226 en MSW3) y 14 familias reci\'en reconocidas (167 en comparaci\'on con 153 en MSW3). Los an\'alisis t\'emporo-geogr\'aficos de descripciones de nuevas especies (en las principales regiones del mundo) sugieren un promedio mundial de descripciones a largo plazo de aproximadamente 25 especies reconocidas por a\~no, siendo el Neotr\'opico la regi\'on con mayor densidad de especies de mam\'iferos en el mundo, seguida de cerca por la region Afrotr\'opical. El MDD proporciona a la comunidad de mastozo\'ologos una base de datos de cambios taxon\'omicos conectada y actualizable, que se suma a los esfuerzos digitales ya establecidos para anfibios (AmphibiaWeb, Amphibian Species of the World), aves (p. ej., Avibase, IOC World Bird List, HBW Alive), reptiles ``no voladores'' (The Reptile Database), y peces (p. ej., FishBase, Catalog of Fishes).},

Because its Animal Welfare Act (AWA) excludes laboratory rats and mice (RM), government veterinarians do not inspect RM laboratories and RM numbers are only partially reported to government agencies1. Without transparent statistics, it is impossible to track efforts to reduce or replace these sentient animals' use or to project government resources needed if AWA coverage were expanded to include them. I obtained annual RM usage data from 16 large American institutions and compared RM numbers to institutions' legally-required reports of their AWA-covered mammals. RM comprised approximately 99.3\% of mammals at these representative institutions. Extrapolating from 780,070 AWA-covered mammals in 2017\textendash 18, I estimate that 111.5 million rats and mice were used per year in this period. If the same proportion of RM undergo painful procedures as are publicly reported for AWA-covered animals, then some 44.5 million mice and rats underwent potentially painful experiments. These data inform the questions of whether the AWA needs an update to cover RM, or whether the NIH should increase transparency of funded animal research. These figures can benchmark progress in reducing animal numbers in general and more specifically, in painful experiments. This estimate is higher than any others available, reflecting the challenges of obtaining statistics without consistent and transparent institutional reports.},

  abstract = {Rodents have the capacity to periodically reach very high numbers in agricultural landscapes, reducing agricultural production, and causing considerable environmental and social problems for farmers and their families. Such rodent problems occur worldwide and have a long history. Currently, mortality enhancing agents (mainly poisons) are the principal method of rodent control. This approach raises environmental, ethical and humane issues, and ignores the inherent high capacity for increase in these species. We argue that it is more appropriate to reduce reproduction than increase mortality. This paper uses house mice in Australia as a case study to explore fertility reduction as a potential alternative to conventional methods of control. In particular, the question of what level of fertility control is required to have a significant effect on population growth is discussed. A computer simulation, based on the life-history strategies of house mice, examined the effect of different levels of fertility control on mouse population dynamics. This simulation provides a reference for future studies of confined populations of mice used to test the effects of fertility control, refines the design of these experiments and identifies the type of data needed to be collected. Immunocontraception, the process of inducing the body immune system to attack its own reproductive cells, is suggested as a method for reducing fertility in rodent populations. The advantages and disadvantages of immunocontraception over mortality-enhancing agents are discussed, as are the potential impacts of social structure on the efficacy of immunocontraception and the possible application of this control method to other rodent pest situations, particularly rodent pest problems in Africa.},

  abstract = {Background PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. Findings To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, \textbackslash documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{wasysym\}  				\textbackslash usepackage\{amsfonts\}  				\textbackslash usepackage\{amssymb\}  				\textbackslash usepackage\{amsbsy\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{mathrsfs\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{upgreek\} 				\textbackslash setlength\{\textbackslash oddsidemargin\}\{-69pt\} 				\textbackslash begin\{document\} \$O\textbackslash left (\textbackslash sqrt \{n\}\textbackslash right)\$ \textbackslash end\{document\}On-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0). Conclusions The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.

  abstract = {Depression and anxiety disorders are serious, growing medical problems that remain poorly understood and inadequately treated. However, psychiatry has proven to be among the least penetrable clinical disciplines for the development of satisfactory in vivo model systems for evaluating novel treatment approaches.Although the rat has traditionally been the species of choice for assessing behavioural effects of manipulations relating to mental illness, there has been a recent explosion in the use of genetically modified mice and enormous research efforts have been focused on developing mouse models of psychiatric disorders.The success of using genetically modified mice as models of psychiatric disorders is largely contingent on the utility of available behavioural models of depression- and anxiety-related behaviours. Here, we assess the current status of research aimed at developing such models.There are several challenges facing the drug discovery industry as it endeavours to identify 'translational models' for anxiety and depression. The development of animal models of specific features of the disease, 'endophenotypes', which have a defined neurocircuitry or genetic basis, is emerging as a useful strategy.Mouse models of depression largely rely on the reaction of the animal to stressful situations, although efforts are underway to develop models of specific features of the disease, such as anhedonia and cognitive dysfunction.Popular tests for anxiety-like behaviours are often based on ethologically relevant behaviours, such as aversion to exposed, well-lit spaces.The use of cognitive-based tasks that involve Pavlovian fear conditioning is one approach that is being used in both mouse and human situations to explain the neural substrates of fear and learning and memory in the brain.Recent emphasis has been placed on developing mouse models of the childhood origins of anxiety and depression as childhood trauma and neglect exert a profound and pervasive influence on risk for depression and anxiety disorders.},

It is hoped that the application of such technologies will result in the identification of novel targets for the treatment of diseases such as depression and to gain a better understanding of the molecular pathophysiological mechanisms that are regulated by current clinically effective antidepressant medications. The advent of these tools has resulted in the need to adopt, refine and develop mouse-specific models for analyses of depression-like behavior or behavioral patterns modulated by antidepressants. In this review, we will focus on the utility of current models (eg forced swim test, tail suspension test, olfactory bulbectomy, learned helplessness, chronic mild stress, drug-withdrawal-induced anhedonia) and research strategies aimed at investigating novel targets relevant to depression in the mouse. We will focus on key questions that are considered relevant for examining the utility of such models. Further, we describe other avenues of research that may give clues as to whether indeed a genetically modified animal has alterations relevant to clinical depression. We suggest that it is prudent and most appropriate to use convergent tests that draw on different antidepressant-related endophenotypes, and complimentary physiological analyses in order to provide a program of information concerning whether a given phenotype is functionally relevant to depression-related pathology.},

Because of their insolubility in biological fluids, their transport between cells and tissues requires that they be assembled into lipoprotein particles. Genetic disruption of the lipoprotein assembly/secretion pathway leads to several human disorders associated with malnutrition and developmental abnormalities. In contrast, patients displaying inappropriately high rates of lipoprotein production display increased risk for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Insights provided by diverse experimental approaches describe an elegant biological adaptation of basic chemical interactions required to overcome the thermodynamic dilemma of producing a stable emulsion vehicle for the transport and tissue targeting of triglycerides. The mammalian lipoprotein assembly/secretion pathway shows an absolute requirement for: (1) the unique amphipathic protein: apolipoprotein B, in a form that is sufficiently large to assemble a lipoprotein particle containing a neutral lipid core; and, (2) a lipid transfer protein (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein-MTP). In the endoplasmic reticulum apolipoprotein B has two distinct metabolic fates: (1) entrance into the lipoprotein assembly pathway within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum; or, (2) degradation in the cytoplasm by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome. The destiny of apolipoprotein B is determined by the relative availability of individual lipids and level of expression of MTP. The dynamically varied expression of cholesterol-7{$\alpha$}-hydroxylase indirectly influences the rate of lipid biosynthesis and the assembly and secretion lipoprotein particles by the liver.},

In this review, we refer to EIB as the bronchoconstrictive response and to EIA when bronchoconstriction is associated with asthma symptoms. EIB is a common occurrence for most of the asthmatic patients, but it also affects more than 10\% of otherwise healthy individuals as shown by epidemiological studies. EIA and EIB have a high prevalence also in elite athletes, especially within endurance type of sports, and an athlete's asthma phenotype has been described. However, the occurrence in elite athletes shows that EIA/EIB, if correctly managed, may not impair physical activity and top sports performance. The pathogenic mechanisms of EIA/EIB classically involve both osmolar and vascular changes in the airways in addition to cooling of the airways with parasympathetic stimulation. Airways inflammation plays a fundamental role in EIA/EIB. Diagnosis and pharmacological management must be carefully performed, with particular consideration of current anti-doping regulations, when caring for athletes. Based on the demonstration that the inhaled asthma drugs do not improve performance in healthy athletes, the doping regulations are presently much less strict than previously. Some sports are at a higher asthma risk than others, probably due to a high environmental exposure while performing the sport, with swimming and chlorine exposure during swimming as one example. It is considered very important for the asthmatic child and adolescent to master EIA/EIB to be able to participate in physical activity on an equal level with their peers, and a precise early diagnosis with optimal treatment follow-up is vital in this aspect. In addition, surprising recent preliminary evidences offer new perspectives for moderate exercise as a potential therapeutic tool for asthmatics.},

  abstract = {A global protein interactome ensures the maintenance of regulatory, signaling and structural processes in cells, but at the same time, aberrations in the repertoire of protein\textendash protein interactions usually cause a disease onset. Many metabolic enzymes catalyze multistage transformation of cholesterol precursors in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Cancer-associated deregulation of these enzymes through various molecular mechanisms results in pathological cholesterol accumulation (its precursors) which can be disease risk factors. This work is aimed at systematization and bioinformatic analysis of the available interactomics data on seventeen enzymes in the cholesterol pathway, encoded by HMGCR, MVK, PMVK, MVD, FDPS, FDFT1, SQLE, LSS, DHCR24, CYP51A1, TM7SF2, MSMO1, NSDHL, HSD17B7, EBP, SC5D, DHCR7 genes. The spectrum of 165 unique and 21 common protein partners that physically interact with target enzymes was selected from several interatomic resources. Among them there were 47 modifying proteins from different protein kinases/phosphatases and ubiquitin-protein ligases/deubiquitinases families. A literature search, enrichment and gene co-expression analysis showed that about a quarter of the identified protein partners was associated with cancer hallmarks and over-represented in cancer pathways. Our results allow to update the current fundamental view on protein\textendash protein interactions and regulatory aspects of the cholesterol synthesis enzymes and annotate of their sub-interactomes in term of possible involvement in cancers that will contribute to prioritization of protein targets for future drug development.},

This study aimed to investigate whether it was possible to use transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology to establish OGDH-/- rats and then study the effect of a high-fat diet (HFD) on these rats. However, after OGDH+/-rats were generated, we were unable to identify any OGDH-/- rats by performing mating experiments with the OGDH+/- rats for almost one year. During the past three years, only OGDH+/- rats were stably established, and correspondingly reduced OGDH expression in the tissues of the OGDH+/- rats was verified. No significant abnormal behaviour was observed in the OGDH+/- rats compared to the wild-type (WT) control rats. However, the OGDH+/- rats were revealed to have higher body weight, and the difference was even significantly greater under the HFD condition. Furthermore, blood biochemical and tissue histological examinations uncovered no abnormalities with normal diets, but a HFD resulted in liver dysfunction with pathological alterations in the OGDH+/- rats. Our results strongly indicate that OGDH homologous knockout is lethal in rats but heterologous OGDH knockout results in vulnerable liver lesions with a HFD. Therefore, the current study may provide a useful OGDH+/- rat model for further investigations of metabolic syndrome and obesity-related hepatic carcinogenesis.},

This paper discusses prospects for the use of the threshold model in morphological systematics to model the evolution of discrete all-or-none traits. There the threshold model has the advantage over 0/1 Markov process models in that it not only accommodates polymorphism within species, but can also allow for correlated evolution of traits with far fewer parameters that need to be inferred. The MCMC importance sampling methods needed to evaluate likelihood ratios for the threshold model are introduced and described in some detail.}

We applied our approach to gene expression data from several sources together with GWAS summary statistics for 48 diseases and traits (average N\,=\,169,331) and found significant tissue-specific enrichments (false discovery rate (FDR)\,{$<$}\,5\%) for 34 traits. In our analysis of multiple tissues, we detected a broad range of enrichments that recapitulated known biology.

  abstract = {Simple Summary Anticoagulant rodenticides are a mainstay of rodent management in many domestic, municipal, agricultural, and conservation settings. Anticoagulant poisoning has poor welfare outcomes for mammals and birds and, worldwide, this means potentially very large numbers of animals are poisoned annually consequent (intended or not) to rodenticide use. Critical differences in use patterns of anticoagulants applied for ongoing rodent control, versus application for rodent eradication especially on islands, have clear implications for animal welfare costs measured as cumulative number of animals affected over time. Here we outline these differences and discuss how animal welfare considerations can be weighed in decisions to use anticoagulant rodenticides for island eradication attempts. Abstract Anticoagulant rodenticides are used to manage rodents in domestic, municipal, agricultural, and conservation settings. In mammals and birds, anticoagulant poisoning causes extensive hemorrhagic disruption, with the primary cause of death being severe internal bleeding occurring over days. The combined severity and duration of these effects represent poor welfare outcomes for poisoned animals. Noting a lack of formal estimates of numbers of rodents and nontarget animals killed by anticoagulant poisoning, the ready availability and worldwide use of anticoagulants suggest that very large numbers of animals are affected globally. Scrutiny of this rodent control method from scientific, public, and regulatory perspectives is being driven largely by mounting evidence of environmental transfer of residual anticoagulants resulting in harmful exposure in wild or domestic animals, but there is also nascent concern for the welfare of targeted rodents. Rodent control incurs a cumulative ledger of animal welfare costs over time as target populations reduced by poisoning eventually recover to an extent requiring another reduction. This `rolling toll' presents a critical contrast to the animal welfare accountancy ledger for eradication scenarios, where rodent populations can be completely removed by methods including anticoagulant use and then kept from coming back (e.g., on islands). Successful eradications remove any future need to control rodents and to incur the associated animal welfare costs.},

  abstract = {Despite strong scientific evidence supporting the benefits of regular exercise for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD), physical inactivity is highly prevalent worldwide. In addition to merely changing well-known risk factors for systemic CVD, regular exercise can also improve cardiovascular health through non-traditional mechanisms. Understanding the pathways through which exercise influences different physiological systems is important and might yield new therapeutic strategies to target pathophysiological mechanisms in CVD. This Review includes a critical discussion of how regular exercise can have antiatherogenic effects in the vasculature, improve autonomic balance (thereby reducing the risk of malignant arrhythmias), and induce cardioprotection against ischaemia\textendash reperfusion injury, independent of~effects on traditional CVD risk factors. This Review also describes how exercise promotes a healthy anti-inflammatory milieu (largely through the release of muscle-derived myokines), stimulates myocardial regeneration, and ameliorates age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, a frequently overlooked non-traditional CVD risk factor. Finally, we discuss how the benefits of exercise might also occur via promotion of a healthy gut microbiota.

  abstract = {The ability to reflect on one's own mental processes, termed metacognition, is a defining feature of human existence [, ]. Consequently, a fundamental question in comparative cognition is whether non-human animals have knowledge of their own cognitive states []. Recent evidence suggests that people and non-human primates [\textendash ], but not less ``cognitively sophisticated'' species [, , ], are capable of metacognition. Here we demonstrate for the first time that rats are capable of metacognition \textendash{} i.e., they know when they do not know the answer in a duration-discrimination test. Before taking the duration test, rats were given the opportunity to decline the test. On other trials, they were not given the option to decline the test. Accurate performance on the duration test yielded a large reward whereas inaccurate performance resulted in no reward. Declining a test yielded a small, but guaranteed, reward. If rats possess knowledge about whether they know or do not know the answer to the test, they would be expected to decline most frequently on difficult tests and show lowest accuracy on difficult tests that cannot be declined []. Our data provide evidence for both predictions and suggest that a non-primate has knowledge of its own cognitive state.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

  abstract = {Human growth hormone (hGH) is secreted in a pulsatile fashion, generally following a circadian rhythm. A number of physiological stimuli can initiate hGH secretion, the most powerful, non-pharmacological of which are sleep and exercise. hGH has many varied roles throughout life, from growth itself, including the turnover of muscle, bone and collagen, to the regulation of selective aspects of metabolic function including increased fat metabolism and the maintenance of a healthier body composition in later life. The exercise-induced growth hormone response (EIGR) is well recognised and although the exact mechanisms remain elusive, a number of candidates have been implicated. These include neural input, direct stimulation by catecholamines, lactate and or nitric oxide, and changes in acid-base balance. Of these, the best candidates appear to be afferent stimulation, nitric oxide and lactate. Resistance training results in a significant EIGR. Evidence suggests that load and frequency are determining factors in the regulation of hGH secretion. Despite the significant EIGR induced by resistance training, much of the stimulus for protein synthesis has been attributed to insulin-like growth factor-1 with modest contributions from the hGH-GH receptor interaction on the cell membrane. The EIGR to endurance exercise is associated with the intensity, duration, frequency and mode of endurance exercise. A number of studies have suggested an intensity 'threshold' exists for EIGR. An exercise intensity above lactate threshold and for a minimum of 10 minutes appears to elicit the greatest stimulus to the secretion of hGH. Exercise training above the lactate threshold may amplify the pulsatile release of hGH at rest, increasing 24-hour hGH secretion. The impact of chronic exercise training on the EIGR remains equivocal. Recent evidence suggests that endurance training results in decreased resting hGH and a blunted EIGR, which may be linked to an increased tissue sensitivity to hGH. While the potential ergogenic effects of exogenous GH administration are attractive to some athletes, the abuse of GH has been associated with a number of pathologies. Identification of a training programme that will optimise the EIGR may present a viable alternative. Ageing is often associated with a progressive decrease in the volume and, especially, the intensity of exercise. A growing body of evidence suggests that higher intensity exercise is effective in eliciting beneficial health, well-being and training outcomes. In a great many cases, the impact of some of the deleterious effects of ageing could be reduced if exercise focused on promoting the EIGR. This review examines the current knowledge and proposed mechanisms for the EIGR, the physiological consequences of endurance, strength and power training on the EIGR and its potential effects in elderly populations, including the aged athlete.},

  abstract = {The efficacy of contraceptive treatments has been extensively tested, and several formulations are effective at reducing fertility in a range of species. However, these formulations should minimally impact the behavior of individuals and populations before a contraceptive is used for population manipulation, but these effects have received less attention. Potential side effects have been identified theoretically and we reviewed published studies that have investigated side effects on behavior and physiology of individuals or population-level effects, which provided mixed results. Physiological side effects were most prevalent. Most studies reported a lack of secondary effects, but were usually based on qualitative data or anecdotes. A meta-analysis on quantitative studies of side effects showed that secondary effects consistently occur across all categories and all contraceptive types. This contrasts with the qualitative studies, suggesting that anecdotal reports are insufficient to investigate secondary impacts of contraceptive treatment. We conclude that more research is needed to address fundamental questions about secondary effects of contraceptive treatment and experiments are fundamental to conclusions. In addition, researchers are missing a vital opportunity to use contraceptives as an experimental tool to test the influence of reproduction, sex and fertility on the behavior of wildlife species.},

  abstract = {Regular exercise promotes whole-body health and prevents disease, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms throughout a whole organism are incompletely understood. Here, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) profiled the temporal transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, lipidome, phosphoproteome, acetylproteome, ubiquitylproteome, epigenome, and immunome in whole blood, plasma, and 18 solid tissues in Rattus norvegicus over 8 weeks of endurance exercise training. The resulting data compendium encompasses 9466 assays across 19 tissues, 25 molecular platforms, and 4 training time points in young adult male and female rats. We identified thousands of shared and tissue- and sex-specific molecular alterations. Temporal multi-omic and multi-tissue analyses demonstrated distinct patterns of tissue remodeling, with widespread regulation of immune, metabolism, heat shock stress response, and mitochondrial pathways. These patterns provide biological insights into the adaptive responses to endurance training over time. For example, exercise training induced heart remodeling via altered activity of the Mef2 family of transcription factors and tyrosine kinases. Translational analyses revealed changes that are consistent with human endurance training data and negatively correlated with disease, including increased phospholipids and decreased triacylglycerols in the liver. Sex differences in training adaptation were widespread, including those in the brain, adrenal gland, lung, and adipose tissue. Integrative analyses generated novel hypotheses of disease relevance, including candidate mechanisms that link training adaptation to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular health, and tissue injury and recovery. The data and analysis results presented in this study will serve as valuable resources for the broader community and are provided in an easily accessible public repository (https://motrpac-data.org/). HighlightsMulti-tissue resource identifies 35,439 analytes regulated by endurance exercise training at 5\% FDR across 211 combinations of tissues and molecular platforms.Interpretation of systemic and tissue-specific molecular adaptations produced hypotheses to help describe the health benefits induced by exercise.Robust sex-specific responses to endurance exercise training are observed across multiple organs at the molecular level.Deep multi-omic profiling of six tissues defines regulatory signals for tissue adaptation to endurance exercise training.All data are available in a public repository, and processed data, analysis results, and code to reproduce major analyses are additionally available in convenient R packages.},

Animals have been poisoned by ingesting treated bait or the carcasses of poisoned rodents. Toxicity is due to the liberation of phosphine gas in the stomach. Clinical signs include central nervous system excitation, depression and vomition. Similarities of clinical signs with other central nervous system toxicants make the diagnosis difficult without a specific diagnostic test. The procedure outlined in this paper detects phosphine liberated from zinc phosphide by the addition of hydrochloric acid as well as the phosphine previously generated by contact with stomach acid.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a highly prevalent condition with unclear pathogenesis. Two competing theories of the pathogenesis of EIB differ regarding the inflammatory basis of this condition. OBJECTIVES: Our goals were to establish whether epithelial cell and mast cell activation with release of inflammatory mediators occurs during EIB and how histamine and cysteinyl leukotriene antagonists alter the airway events occurring during EIB. METHODS: Induced sputum was used to measure mast cell mediators and eicosanoids at baseline and 30 minutes after exercise challenge in 25 individuals with asthma with EIB. In a randomized, double-blind crossover study, the cysteinyl leukotriene antagonist montelukast and antihistamine loratadine or two matched placebos were administered for two doses before exercise challenge. MAIN RESULTS: The percentage of columnar epithelial cells in induced sputum at baseline was associated with the severity of EIB. After exercise challenge, histamine, tryptase, and cysteinyl leukotrienes significantly increased and prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane B(2) significantly decreased in the airways, and there was an increase in columnar epithelial cells in the airways. The concentration of columnar epithelial cells was associated with the levels of histamine and cysteinyl leukotrienes in the airways. Treatment with montelukast and loratadine inhibited the release of cysteinyl leukotrienes and histamine into the airways, but did not inhibit the release of columnar epithelial cells into the airways. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that epithelial cells, mast cell mediators, and eicosanoids are released into the airways during EIB, supporting an inflammatory basis for EIB.},

However, it is not clearly understood which type of PUFA is responsible for the worsening of steatosis. This study observed a marked accumulation of hepatic triacylglycerol and cholesterol in fatty acid desaturase 2 knockout (FADS2-/-) mice lacking both C18 and {$\geq$} C20 PUFAs that were fed a PUFA-depleted diet. Hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation was associated with enhanced sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1-dependent lipogenesis and decreased triacylglycerol secretion into the plasma via very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Furthermore, upregulation of cholesterol synthesis contributed to increased hepatic cholesterol content in FADS2-/- mice. These results suggest that {$\geq$} C20 PUFAs synthesized by FADS2 are important in regulating hepatic triacylglycerol and cholesterol accumulation during PUFA deficiency.},

In the present study the chronic mild stress rat model of depression was used to reveal stress-susceptible and stress-resilient rats. Large-scale proteomics was used to map hippocampal protein alterations in different stress states. Membrane proteins were successfully captured by two-phase separation and peptide based proteomics. Using iTRAQ labeling coupled with mass spectrometry, more than 2000 proteins were quantified and 73 proteins were found to be differentially expressed. Stress susceptibility was associated with increased expression of a sodium-channel protein (SCN9A) currently investigated as a potential antidepressant target. Differential protein profiling also indicated stress susceptibility to be associated with deficits in synaptic vesicle release involving SNCA, SYN-1, and AP-3. Our results indicate that increased oxidative phosphorylation (COX5A, NDUFB7, NDUFS8, COX5B, and UQCRB) within the hippocampal CA regions is part of a stress-protection mechanism.},

Recently, cross-species comparisons of social behavior have offered important new insights into the evolution of pro-sociality. Here, we present a rodent analog of the Pro-social Choice Task that controls strategic components, de-confounds other-regarding choice motives from the animals' natural tendencies to maximize own food access and directly tests the effect of social context on choice allocation. We trained pairs of rats\textemdash an actor and a partner rat\textemdash in a double T-maze task where actors decided between two alternatives only differing in the reward delivered to the partner. The ``own reward'' choice yielded a reward only accessible to the actor whereas the ``both reward'' choice produced an additional reward for a partner (partner condition) or an inanimate toy (toy Condition), located in an adjacent compartment. We found that actors chose ``both reward'' at levels above chance and more often in the partner than in the toy condition. Moreover, we show that this choice pattern adapts to the current social context and that the observed behavior is stable over time.}

Methods for reliably inducing and measuring positive affect are critical, but both have been limited in availability. In rats, one promising way of inducing positive affective states is by human-simulated rough and tumble play or `tickling' [3,4]. However, in humans tickling induces both pleasure and displeasure, and neither an established non-verbal indicator of positive affect, the Duchenne smile, nor laughter detects this variation [5,6]. Rats also show individual differences in response to tickling [7], and this variation needs to be readily quantified if we are to ensure that tickling is only implemented where it generates positive affect. Here, we use a validated and objective measure of affective valence, the affective bias test [8], to show that 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations provide a quantifiable and graded measure of positive affect that accurately reflects the positive state induced by this human\textendash rat interaction.},

  abstract = {Many exotic vertebrate species have been introduced either accidentally or intentionally into the Australian environment. Native species have also become pests due to changes in landscape use. Management of these pest populations, whether introduced or indigenous, is of concern both nationally and internationally. Public approval of existing pest control techniques involving lethal agents (poisoning, shooting, trapping, or disease) has declined in favour of alternative techniques, which are more humane, cost effective, species-specific, environmentally friendly, and suitable for delivery on a continental scale. Population management through disruption of reproduction rather than through the use of mortality agents has gained acceptance in the past 10-15 years. This has led to considerable research into the development of immunocontraceptive agents, for example to prevent mouse populations irrupting to plague proportions in cereal-growing regions of Australia. We have examined whether mouse populations can be managed with fertility control delivered using a transmissible mouse-specific virus (mouse cytomegalovirus, MCMV), engineered to carry an infertility agent. Field and laboratory results, as well as computer modelling, show excellent prospects for the use of vaccines based on MCMV. However, the efficiency of transmission of infertility remains a major challenge for the current research program. The public acceptability of the technology is yet to be confirmed. The issues of species specificity, delivery system stability, transmission efficiency, and other potential or perceived risks require open and wide-ranging debate, nationally and internationally, before trial field experiments of a genetically modified virus for controlling field populations of mammals could occur.},

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {Management of overabundant rodents at a landscape scale is complex but often required to sustainably reduce rodent abundance below damage thresholds. Current conventional techniques such as poisoning are not species specific, with some approaches becoming increasingly unacceptable to the general public. Fertility control, first proposed for vertebrate pest management over 5 decades ago, has gained public acceptance because it is perceived as a potentially more species-specific and humane approach compared with many lethal methods. An ideal fertility control agent needs to induce infertility across one or more breeding seasons, be easily delivered to an appropriate proportion of the population, be species specific with minimal side-effects (behavioral or social structure changes), and be environmentally benign and cost effective. To date, effective fertility control of rodents has not been demonstrated at landscape scales and very few products have achieved registration. Reproductive targets for fertility control include disrupting the hormonal feedback associated with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, gonad function, fertilization, and/or early implantation. We review progress on the oral delivery of various agents for which laboratory studies have demonstrated efficacy in females and/or males and synthesize progress with the development and/or use of synthetic steroids, plant extracts, ovarian specific peptides, and immunocontraceptive vaccines. There are promising results for field application of synthetic steroids (levonorgestrel, quinestrol), chemosterilants (4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide), and some plant extracts (triptolide). For most fertility control agents, more research is essential to enable their efficient and cost-effective delivery such that rodent impacts at a population level are mitigated and food security is improved.},

  abstract = {Developing reliable, predictive animal models for complex psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, is essential to increase our understanding of the neurobiological basis of the disorder and for the development of novel drugs with improved therapeutic efficacy. All available animal models of schizophrenia fit into four different induction categories: developmental, drug-induced, lesion or genetic manipulation, and the best characterized examples of each type are reviewed herein. Most rodent models have behavioural phenotype changes that resemble `positive-like' symptoms of schizophrenia, probably reflecting altered mesolimbic dopamine function, but fewer models also show altered social interaction, and learning and memory impairment, analogous to negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia respectively. The negative and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are resistant to treatment with current antipsychotics, even after remission of the psychosis, which limits their therapeutic efficacy. The MATRICS initiative developed a consensus on the core cognitive deficits of schizophrenic patients, and recommended a standardized test battery to evaluate them. More recently, work has begun to identify specific rodent behavioural tasks with translational relevance to specific cognitive domains affected in schizophrenia, and where available this review focuses on reporting the effect of current and potential antipsychotics on these tasks. The review also highlights the need to develop more comprehensive animal models that more adequately replicate deficits in negative and cognitive symptoms. Increasing information on the neurochemical and structural CNS changes accompanying each model will also help assess treatments that prevent the development of schizophrenia rather than treating the symptoms, another pivotal change required to enable new more effective therapeutic strategies to be developed.

  abstract = {There are over twenty rodent models of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), with most reflecting a recognized ADHD subtype. Of these, only five rat models (Neonatal 6-Hydroxydopamine, Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat, Prenatal Alcohol Exposure, Prenatal Nicotine Exposure, and Lphn3 Knockout) and three mouse models (Dopamine Transporter Knockout, Neurokinin-1 Receptor Knockout, and Prenatal Nicotine Exposure) have a sufficient number of publications to explore their suitability for modelling ADHD with respect to core features, executive dysfunction, and medication effects. An updated view is advanced specifying that an informative model encompasses elevated drug use risk as a means to assess ADHD/Substance Use Disorder (SUD) comorbidity, a common co-occurrence among patients. Based on the full range of symptoms and medication effects, it is concluded that the Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (specifically the Charles River Laboratories substrain) has the most translational support at this stage to model ADHD/SUD comorbidity. The Lphn3 knockout rat model and the prenatal nicotine exposure mouse model are strong contenders if additional validation work is performed, as they have a high degree of construct validity pertaining to genetic and environmental etiologies of ADHD. Research using validated rodent models of ADHD is warranted because their study can provide insights for drug discovery geared toward the development of safer ADHD therapeutics, particularly for adolescent patients.},

Traditional lethal control programs, however, are not always legal, wise, safe, or publicly acceptable; thus, alternative approaches are necessary. Immunocontraception of free-ranging wildlife has reached the management level, with success across a large variety of species. Thus far, the immunocontraceptive research and management applications emphasis have been centered on porcine zona pellucida and gonadotropin-releasing hormone vaccines. Contraceptive success has been achieved in more than 85 different wildlife species, at the level of both the individual animal and the population. At the population management level with free-ranging species, the primary focus has been on wild horses, urban deer, bison, and African elephants. The challenges in the development and application of vaccine-based wildlife contraceptives are diverse and include differences in efficacy across species, safety of vaccines during pregnancy, the development of novel delivery systems for wild and wary free-ranging animals, and the constraints of certain non-contraceptive effects, such as effects on behavior. Beyond the constraints imposed by the public and a host of regulatory concerns, there exists a real limitation for funding of well-designed programs that apply this type of fertility control.},

In an observational study, they further observe that these vocalizations both correlate with and predict appetitive components of the play behavioral repertoire. Additional experiments characterized eliciting conditions for high USVs. Without prior play exposure, rats separated by a screen vocalized less than playing rats, but after only 1 play session, separated rats vocalized more than playing rats. This finding suggested that high USVs were linked to a motivational state rather than specific play behaviors or general activity. Furthermore, individual rats vocalized more in a chamber associated with play than in a habituated control chamber. Finally, congruent and incongruent motivational manipulations modulated vocalization expression. Although play deprivation enhanced high USVs, an arousing but aversive stimulus (bright light) reduced them. Taken together, these findings suggest that high USVs may index an appetitive motivation to play in juvenile rats. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Low aerobic exercise capacity is a powerful predictor of premature morbidity and mortality for healthy adults as well as those with cardiovascular disease. For aged populations, poor performance on treadmill or extended walking tests indicates closer proximity to future health declines. Together, these findings suggest a fundamental connection between aerobic capacity and longevity. OBJECTIVES: Through artificial selective breeding, we developed an animal model system to prospectively test the association between aerobic exercise capacity and survivability (aerobic hypothesis). METHODS AND RESULTS: Laboratory rats of widely diverse genetic backgrounds (N:NIH stock) were selectively bred for low or high intrinsic (inborn) treadmill running capacity. Cohorts of male and female rats from generations 14, 15, and 17 of selection were followed for survivability and assessed for age-related declines in cardiovascular fitness including maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), myocardial function, endurance performance, and change in body mass. Median lifespan for low exercise capacity rats was 28\% to 45\% shorter than high capacity rats (hazard ratio, 0.06; P{$<$}0.001). VO(2max), measured across adulthood was a reliable predictor of lifespan (P{$<$}0.001). During progression from adult to old age, left ventricular myocardial and cardiomyocyte morphology, contractility, and intracellular Ca(2+) handling in both systole and diastole, as well as mean blood pressure, were more compromised in rats bred for low aerobic capacity. Physical activity levels, energy expenditure (Vo(2)), and lean body mass were all better sustained with age in rats bred for high aerobic capacity. CONCLUSIONS: These data obtained from a contrasting heterogeneous model system provide strong evidence that genetic segregation for aerobic exercise capacity can be linked with longevity and are useful for deeper mechanistic exploration of aging.},

  abstract = {Painless bleeding in a patient presenting from the community with elevated coagulation studies rarely makes the physicians suspect superwarfarin or rodenticide poisoning. Although a significant number of superwarfarin exposure cases are diagnosed every year, we believe there appears to be delay in diagnosis and confusion in determining what is the ideal way to treat and monitor these patients during the management. This is the first thorough literature review of all the reported cases of superwarfarin poisoning which also studied the clinical presentation, management and follow-up patterns. We present a 70-year-old man who presented to the emergency room with epistaxis, melena, cola-colored urine with elevated prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and international normalized ratio (INR). Mixing studies showed complete correction of coagulopathy indicative of factor deficiency. Additional history revealed that the patient had arguments with family member at home and made us suspect superwarfarin exposure. Qualitative brodifacoum testing was positive and was managed with fresh frozen plasma and high doses of vitamin K1 (phytomenadione) with serial monitoring of INR and clinical symptoms. Superwarfarin poisoning should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient who presents with above clinical and laboratory profile especially in the absence of any history of coagulopathy or anticoagulant use. We want to raise public and especially physician awareness that history taking, early diagnosis and managing in right clinical setting play a significant role in survival of these patients.

  abstract = {The increased prevalence of rodents resistant to warfarin led to the development of the hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant brodifacoum. A 25-year-old man attempted suicide by consuming four boxes of d-CON Mouse-Prufe II\textregistered; each box contains 42 g of bait that is 0.005\% brodifacoum. He presented to a hospital nine days later with syncope, hematochezia, gross hematuria, epistaxis, anemia, and a severe coagulopathy. Radiographic studies were consistent with pleural, pericardial, and mediastinal hemorrhages. Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma were given, and he was later discharged on oral phytonadione (vitamin K1). The patient's coagulopathy recurred, necessitating multiple plasma transfusions and prolonged treatment with oral phytonadione. Fifteen weeks after hospital discharge, he presented again with a history of additional brodifacoum ingestion. Neurologic status was initially normal, but in the emergency department he suddenly became comatose soon after emesis was induced with syrup of ipecac. Computed tomography of the brain revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage that led to brain death less than 24 hours later. This case demonstrates the severe and prolonged coagulopathy that can result from ingestion of brodifacoum, a compound that has a toxic potency about 200-fold that of warfarin and a half-life as much as 60 times longer.},

Accuracy was measured by two measures of the distance between the true tree and the estimate of the tree, one measure sensitive to accuracy of branch lengths and the other not. The distance-matrix methods (Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining) performed best when they were constrained from estimating negative branch lengths; all comparisons with other methods used this constraint. Parsimony and compatibility had similar results, with compatibility generally inferior; Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining had similar results, with neighbor joining generally slightly inferior. Maximum likelihood was the most successful method overall, although for short sequences Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining were sometimes better. Bias of the estimates was inferred by measuring whether the independent estimates of a tree for different data sets were closer to the true tree than to each other. Parsimony and compatibility had particular difficulty with inaccuracy and bias when substitution rates varied among different branches. When rates of evolution varied among different sites, all methods showed signs of inaccuracy and bias.},

Exercising regularly is recommended for both healthy and diseased populations to improve health. However, there are sex-specific adaptations to exercise that often are not taken into consideration. While endurance exercise training alters the human skeletal muscle epigenome and subsequent gene expression, it is still unknown whether it does so differently in men and women, potentially leading to sex-specific physiological adaptations. Elucidating sex differences in genetics, epigenetics, gene regulation and expression in response to exercise will have great health implications, as it may enable gene targets in future clinical interventions and may better individualised interventions. This review will cover this topic and highlight the recent findings of sex-specific genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression studies, address the gaps in the field, and offer recommendations for future research.},

The observed sex differences in exercise physiology are underpinned by the sex chromosome complement, sex hormones and, on a molecular level, the epigenome and transcriptome. Future research in the field should aim to include both sexes, control for menstrual cycle factors, conduct large-scale and ethnically diverse studies, conduct meta-analyses to consolidate findings from various studies, leverage unique cohorts (such as post-menopausal, transgender, and those with sex chromosome abnormalities), as well as integrate tissue and cell-specific -omics data.

  abstract = {The present paper is an attempt to provide a set of models which will be more useful in the analysis of macro-evolutionary events than the classical models of population genetics. This is accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems that in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations this can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of adaptive zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive topography for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive topography for gene frequencies. This shows that for most phenotypic characters under natural selection, the evolution of the average phenotype in a population is always toward an adaptive zone of high mean fitness (W\&\#x304;) in the phenotype space. Frequency-dependent selection may cause the average phenotype to evolve away from its adaptive zone, decreasing the mean fitness of individuals in the population; different types of frequency-dependent selection are classified as to whether or not they lead to such maladaptive evolution. A simple formula for estimating the minimum selective mortality per generation necessary to explain observed rates of phenotypic evolution is derived (assuming that genetic drift was not involved). The minimum mortality rates needed to explain observed rates of evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary mammals are very small, typically about one selective death per million individuals per generation. This leads to consideration of the hypothesis that these changes were caused by random genetic drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the observed evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations, with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain. Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that if stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is not very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones may be an important mechanism of evolution in populations of effective size in the hundreds or thousands. These results support the contention that random genetic drift may play a significant role in phenotypic evolution.}

  abstract = {A basic principle of natural selection on correlated characters is expressed as an adaptive topography for the vector of mean phenotypes in a population. Under some simple conditions on the pattern of phenotypic and genetic covariation within populations, selection only on body size, certain types of multivariate selection, and random genetic drift in a stochastic phylogeny are each expected to produce allometric evolution, i.e., straight lines or linear regressions on logarithmic coordinates. The orientation of these lines is determined by genetic parameters of the populations. Using this theory, phylogenetic or comparative information can be combined with experimental data on population genetic parameters to test hypotheses about past selective forces. Data from selection experiments on brain and body weights in mice support the conclusions that [1] the short-term differentiation of brain and body sizes in very closely related mammalian forms resulted either from directional selection mostly on body size with changes in brain sizes largely a genetically correlated response, or from random genetic drift; [2] during the long-term allometric diversification within most mammalian orders there has been more net directional selection on brain sizes than on body sizes. It is suggested that encephalization in primates decreased the genetic correlation between brain size and body size within populations, which facilitated further encephalization in the human lineage by avoiding antagonistic selection on brain and body sizes. The evolution of brain:body ontogeny is briefly discussed.}

Results of TWAS analyses are often interpreted as indicating a genetically mediated relationship between gene expression and the phenotype, but because the traditional TWAS framework does not model the uncertainty in the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effect estimates6,7, this interpretation is not justified. In this study we outline the implications of this issue. Using simulations, we show severely inflated type 1 error rates for TWAS when evaluating a null hypothesis of no genetic relationship between gene expression and the phenotype. Moreover, in our application to real data only 51\% of the TWAS associations were confirmed with local genetic correlation8 analysis, an approach which correctly evaluates the same null. Our results thus demonstrate that TWAS is unsuitable for investigating genetic relationships between gene expression and a phenotype.},

Although nasal and bronchial epithelia are similar in their histological structure and cellular composition, genetic and epigenetic regulation may differ across tissues. Advanced methods have enabled comprehensive, high-throughput methylation profiling of different tissues (bronchial or nasal epithelial cells, whole blood or isolated mononuclear cells), in subjects with respiratory conditions, aiming to elucidate gene regulation mechanisms and identify new biomarkers. Several genes and CpGs have been suggested as asthma biomarkers, though research on allergic rhinitis is still lacking. The most common differentially methylated loci presented in both blood and nasal samples are ACOT7, EPX, KCNH2, SIGLEC8, TNIK, FOXP1, ATPAF2, ZNF862, ADORA3, ARID3A, IL5RA, METRNL and ZFPM1.

Whereas the etiology of ADHD remains unknown, growing evidence indicates a genetic involvement in the development of this disorder. The brain circuits associated with ADHD are rich in monoamines, which are involved in the mechanism of action of psychostimulants and other medications used to treat this disorder. Dopamine (DA) is believed to play a major role in ADHD but other neurotransmitters are certainly also involved. Genetically modified mice have become an indispensable tool used to analyze the contribution of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of human disorders. Although rodent models cannot fully recapitulate complex human psychiatric disorders such as ADHD, transgenic mice offer an opportunity to directly investigate in vivo the specific roles of novel candidate genes identified in ADHD patients. Several knock-out and transgenic mouse models have been proposed as ADHD models, mostly based on targeting genes involved in DA transmission, including the gene encoding the dopamine transporter (DAT1). These mutant models provided an opportunity to evaluate the contribution of dopamine-related processes to brain pathology, to dissect the neuronal circuitry and molecular mechanisms involved in the antihyperkinetic action of psychostimulants and to evaluate novel treatments for ADHD. New transgenic models mouse models targeting other genes have recently been proposed for ADHD. Here, we discuss the recent advances and pitfalls in modeling ADHD endophenotypes in genetically altered animals.},

Utilizing an integrative multi-omics approach with data generated by the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC), we identified profound sexual dimorphism in the dynamic response of rat scWAT to endurance exercise training. Despite similar cardiorespiratory improvements, only male rats reduced whole-body adiposity, scWAT adipocyte size, and total scWAT triglyceride abundance with training. Multi-omic analyses of adipose tissue integrated with phenotypic measures identified sex-specific training responses including enrichment of mTOR signaling in females, while males displayed enhanced mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. Overall, this study reinforces our understanding that sex impacts scWAT biology and provides a rich resource to interrogate responses of scWAT to endurance training.},

  abstract = {Rat and mouse control methods potentially affect the welfare of many millions of animals every year. Here, the humaneness of the methods used in the UK and the USA is assessed in terms of their speed and mode of action, the appearance and behaviour of affected animals, experiences of human victims, long-term effects on animals that survive exposure, and welfare risks to non-target animals. Several methods emerge as relatively humane: cyanide, alpha-chloralose, electrocution traps and well-designed snap traps all usually kill swiftly and with little distress. Preventative methods such as rodent-proofing are also humane, as well as an essential \textemdash{} and probably under-used \textemdash{} component of effective control. However, anticoagulant poisons, the most common means of controlling rodents, generally take several days to kill, during which time they cause distress, disability and/or pain. Sub-lethally affected animals are also likely to experience haemorrhages and their sequelae, and carnivores feeding on affected rodents may be secondarily poisoned. The acute rodenticides zinc phosphide and calciferol are also generally inhumane, the former typically causing severe pain for several hours, and the latter, pain and illness for several days. Sticky boards, to which rodents become adhered by the feet and fur until they are killed or simply eventually die, also raise very serious welfare concerns. This evidence highlights remarkable paradoxes in the way society treats different classes of animal, and argues for more education, legislation and research targeted at reducing the vast numbers of rodents currently killed inhumanely.},

  abstract = {Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic disorder that is accompanied by psychosis and a broad spectrum of behavioural, cognitive and social deficits. It usually strikes in young adulthood. Currently, treatment is exclusively symptomatic, and medication has no direct, lasting influence on causal pathophysiology.Improved knowledge of the developmental anomalies provoked by genetic, epigenetic and environmental triggers of schizophrenia has fostered interest in potential 'disease-modifying' strategies for either slowing its progression or preventing its appearance in vulnerable young adults.Although awaiting further confirmation, clinical studies of pharmacotherapeutic and psychosocial and/or cognitive-behavioural interventions in young, high-risk individuals seeking help have collectively yielded evidence for a reduction in the transition to psychosis.Nonetheless, only a third or so of clinically high-risk individuals convert, so it is important to improve the prediction of transition at the level of individuals by the use of biomarkers. Multi-modal approaches combining, for example, circulating biomarkers, sensory/cognitive deficits and brain imaging hold particular promise.Although animal models for schizophrenia have limitations, diverse pharmacological treatments applied during adolescence preclude the appearance of a schizophrenia-like phenotype in adult rodents.Studies exploiting these in vivo models, as well as novel cellular paradigms such as human induced pluripotent stem cells, are refining our understanding of the cellular substrates leading to schizophrenia, and hence unveiling potentially novel targets for medication.In conclusion, though much work still remains to be undertaken, recent progress is raising the hope that it may eventually be possible to interrupt the course of schizophrenia, as well as other disorders characterized by psychosis. Of particular interest would be hybrid strategies that both relieve distress in young, at-risk individuals and reduce their conversion.},

In rats and mice, high all-year birth rates, high levels of dispersal and promiscous mating systems suggest that, if immunocontraception was used alone, {$>$} 90\% of the population would have to sterilized to achieve the desired control. In Britain, the grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) may be a better candidate to investigate the feasibility of a contraceptive vaccine in rodents. This introduced species is a seasonal breeder with a much lower population turnover than rats or mice. As well as causing damage to woodland, it has ousted the native red squirrel (S. valgaris) from most of the UK. A human and selective method for the control of grey squirrels is therefore highly desirable. Numerous sperm-specific antigens have been identified on rodent spermatozoa. Monoclonal antibodies to particular components block sperm-egg interactions in laboratory animals and cross-react with grey squirrel spermatozoa. In vitro fertilization assays indicate that squirrel sperm-egg binding may be inhibited also. Currently, a cDNA library obtained from grey squirrel testis is being screened to identify genes encoding specific sperm antigens involved in fertilization. Methods of enhancing immunogenicity after oral immunization using microparticle carriers and immune-stimulating complexes are currently under investigation.},

  abstract = {While the beneficial effects of repeated exercise on metabolism, immune responses, and tissue composition, structure, and function are recognized, the molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptive response are incompletely understood. Here, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) profiled the longitudinal molecular adaptation to 8 weeks of endurance exercise training in whole blood, plasma, and 18 solid tissues in the mammalian model Rattus norvegicus. We employed a multi-omic approach for complete molecular characterization through transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, ubiquitylproteomics, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and multiplexed immunoassays. This compilation of 211 datasets across 19 tissues, 25 molecular assays, and 4 training time points in young male and female animals represents the most comprehensive resource to explore the tissue-specific response to exercise training to date. Temporal multi-omic and multi-tissue integration demonstrated that heart and skeletal muscle shared similar temporal responses, reflecting a concerted adaptation of mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism. Integrative multi-omic network analysis revealed connections between the heat shock-mediated stress response and mitochondrial biogenesis processes. Extensive changes in heart signaling were observed through altered activity of transcription factors, such as Mef2, and tyrosine kinases, which were linked to remodeling of the extracellular matrix and intercellular interactions critical for heart structural adaptation. Liver lipids were modulated, with increased phospholipids and decreased triacylglycerols, and a robust response was observed through mitochondrial protein acetylation. Immune-related pathways were enriched in several tissues. Many sex-related differences were observed, including male-specific recruitment of immune cells to adipose tissues, female-specific immune enrichments in the small intestine, an anticorrelated transcriptional response in the adrenal gland related to the stress response, and an anticorrelated lung phosphosignature of PRKACA substrates. Altogether, this MoTrPAC resource provides an unprecedented view of the effects of exercise across an organism, revealing mechanistic details of how exercise impacts mammalian health.}

In spite of the occurrence of many incidents of primary or secondary AR-exposure and poisoning of non-target animals, these incidents have been reported only for individual countries, and there has been no comprehensive worldwide study or review. Furthermore, the AR exposure pathway in raptors has not yet been clearly identified. The aim of this review is therefore to comprehensively analyze the global incidence of primary and secondary AR-exposure in non-target animals, and to explore the exposure pathways. We reviewed the published literature, which reported AR residues in the non-target animals between 1998 and 2015, indicated that various raptor species had over 60\% AR- detection rate and have a risk of AR poisoning. According to several papers studied on diets of raptor species, although rodents are the most common diets of raptors, some raptor species prey mainly on non-rodents. Therefore, preying on targeted rodents does not necessarily explain all causes of secondary AR-exposure of raptors. Since AR residue-detection was also reported in non-target mammals, birds, reptiles and invertebrates, which are the dominant prey of some raptors, AR residues in these animals, as well as in target rodents, could be the exposure source of ARs to raptors.},

  abstract = {Disadvantageous inequity aversion (IA) is a behavioural response to an inequitable outcome distribution yielding a smaller reward to oneself than to a conspecific, given comparable efforts to obtain the reward. This behavioural response aims to minimize unfair reward distributions. It has been proposed to be essential for the emergence of cooperation. Humans show choice patterns compatible with IA and, as recently suggested, cooperative nonhuman species such as primates, corvids and dogs also respond negatively to disadvantageous inequitable outcomes. Here, we asked whether rats are sensitive to such inequitable outcomes. In a double T-maze apparatus, actor rats could choose to enter one of two different compartments after which a conspecific (partner rat) entered the adjoining partner compartment. One side of the paired compartments was associated with an equitable reward distribution (identical amount for the actor and the partner) whereas entry into the other paired compartment led to an inequitable reward distribution (in which the partner received a larger reward). Both compartments yielded an identical reward for the actor. Using a within-subjects design, we compared the actor rats' choices in the social condition with a nonsocial baseline control condition in which a toy rat replaced the partner rat. Actor rats exhibited disadvantageous IA: they preferred equitable outcomes in the social, but not the toy condition. Moreover, there was large variability in IA between rats. This heterogeneity in social preference could be partly explained by a social-hierarchy-dependent sensitivity to IA, as dominant animals showed higher IA than subordinate animals. Our study provides evidence for social-hierarchy-dependent disadvantageous IA in social vertebrates. Our findings are consistent with the notion that a sense of fairness may have evolved long before humans emerged. IA may therefore be a basic organizational principle, shared by many social species, that shapes the intricate social dynamics of individuals interrelating in larger groups.},

We generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and in the genetic regulation of gene expression across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx, v8 release). We demonstrate that sex influences gene expression levels and cellular composition of tissue samples across the human body. A total of 37\% of all genes exhibit sex-biased expression in at least one tissue. We identify cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with sex-differentiated effects and characterize their cellular origin. By integrating sex-biased eQTLs with genome-wide association study data, we identify 58 gene-trait associations that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These findings provide an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation.,                     , Sex affects gene expression and its genetic regulation across tissues. Sex effects on gene expression were measured in 44 GTEx human tissue sources and integrated with genotypes of 838 subjects. Sex-biased expression is present in numerous biological pathways and is associated to sex-differentiated transcriptional regulation. Sex-biased expression quantitative trait loci in cis (sex-biased eQTLs) are partially mediated by cellular abundances and reveal gene-trait associations.

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in , which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.},

  abstract = {Many aspects of the historical relationships between populations in a species are reflected in genetic data. Inferring these relationships from genetic data, however, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a statistical model for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in multiple populations. In our model, the sampled populations in a species are related to their common ancestor through a graph of ancestral populations. Using genome-wide allele frequency data and a Gaussian approximation to genetic drift, we infer the structure of this graph. We applied this method to a set of 55 human populations and a set of 82 dog breeds and wild canids. In both species, we show that a simple bifurcating tree does not fully describe the data; in contrast, we infer many migration events. While some of the migration events that we find have been detected previously, many have not. For example, in the human data, we infer that Cambodians trace approximately 16\% of their ancestry to a population ancestral to other extant East Asian populations. In the dog data, we infer that both the boxer and basenji trace a considerable fraction of their ancestry (9\% and 25\%, respectively) to wolves subsequent to domestication and that East Asian toy breeds (the Shih Tzu and the Pekingese) result from admixture between modern toy breeds and ``ancient'' Asian breeds. Software implementing the model described here, called TreeMix, is available at http://treemix.googlecode.com.}

  abstract = {Genetic information contains a record of the history of our species, and technological advances have transformed our ability to access this record. Many studies have used genome-wide data from populations today to learn about the peopling of the globe and subsequent adaptation to local conditions. Implicit in this research is the assumption that the geographic locations of people today are informative about the geographic locations of their ancestors in the distant past. However, it is now clear that long-range migration, admixture, and population replacement subsequent to the initial out-of-Africa expansion have altered the genetic structure of most of the world's human populations. In light of this we argue that it is time to critically reevaluate current models of the peopling of the globe, as well as the importance of natural selection in determining the geographic distribution of phenotypes. We specifically highlight the transformative potential of ancient DNA. By accessing the genetic make-up of populations living at archaeologically known times and places, ancient DNA makes it possible to directly track migrations and responses to natural selection.}

Contraceptive formulations suitable for oral delivery would permit broader remote application in wildlife species.                                         \textbullet{}               This study evaluated the contraceptive effect and immune response to two novel injectable immunocontraceptive formulations targeting the Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH): MAF-IMX294 and MAF-IMX294P conjugates, both identified as having potential as oral contraceptives. The study also explored whether in multiparous species immunocontraceptives may either totally prevent reproduction or also affect litter size.                                         \textbullet{}               Female rats, chosen as a model species, were given three doses of either MAF-IMX294 or MAF-IMX294P to compare anti-GnRH immune response and reproductive output up to 310~days post-treatment.                                         \textbullet{}               Both formulations induced anti-GnRH antibody titres in 100\% of rats and significantly impaired fertility compared to control animals. Following treatment with MAF-IMX294 and MAF-IMX294P 0 of 9 and 1 of 10 females respectively produced litters following the first mating challenge 45~days post-treatment, compared to 9 of 9 control animals.                                         \textbullet{}               Across the whole 310~day study period 7 of 9 females from the MAF-IMX294 group and 10 of 10 females in the MAF-IMX294P group became fertile, producing at least one litter throughout six mating challenges.                                         \textbullet{}               No significant differences were found between the two formulations in antibody titre response or duration of contraceptive effect, with an average time to first pregnancy of 166~days for MAF-IMX294 and 177~days for MAF-IMX294P for all females that became fertile.                                         \textbullet{}               Following treatment with MAF-IMX294 and MAF-IMX294P the first litter produced post-infertility in treated females was significantly smaller than in control animals. This indicates treatment with immunocontraceptives may induce an overall suppression of fecundity extending past an initial infertility effect. This increases the potential long-term impact of these immunocontraceptives in multiparous species such as commensal rodents.},

  abstract = {[1st paragraph] At first sight, Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) appears to be straightforward. The user defines a full probability model, perhaps using one of the programs discussed in this issue; an underlying sampling engine takes the model definition and returns a sequence of dependent samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters, given the supplied data. The user can derive any summary of the posterior distribution from this sample. For example, to calculate a 95\% credible interval for a parameter ?, it suffices to take 1000 MCMC iterations of ? and sort them so that ?12{$<$}...1000. The credible interval estimate is then (?25, ?975). However, there is a price to be paid for this simplicity. Unlike most numerical methods used in statistical inference, MCMC does not give a clear indication of whether it has converged. The underlying Markov chain theory only guarantees that the distribution of the output will converge to the posterior in the limit as the number of iterations increases to infinity. The user is generally ignorant about how quickly convergence occurs, and therefore has to fall back on post hoc testing of the sampled output. By convention, the sample is divided into two parts: a ?burn in? period during which all samples are discarded, and the remainder of the run in which the chain is considered to have converged sufficiently close to the limiting distribution to be used. Two questions then arise: 1. How long should the burn in period be? 2. How many samples are required to accurately estimate posterior quantities of interest? The coda package for R contains a set of functions designed to help the user answer these questions. Some of these convergence diagnostics are simple graphical ways of summarizing the data. Others are formal statistical tests.}

In addition, many symptoms of the disorder are difficult to measure directly in rodents. These challenges have not daunted neuroscientists who are capitalizing on even subtle overlaps between this uniquely human disorder and rodent behavior. In this perspective, we detail the features of ideal animal models of schizophrenia, the potential utility of such models, and the rodent behaviors used to model certain aspects of schizophrenia. The development of such models will provide critical tools to understand the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and novel insights into therapeutic approaches to this complex disorder.},

  abstract = {Lethal rodenticides and other lethal tools of managing commensal rodent populations long-term are not sustainable due to population rebounds and increasing resistance to rodenticides. The use of integrated pest management (IPM) programs are more prevalent due to consumer desire to decrease rodenticide use and utilize environmentally friendly, humane methods. IPM plans often require multiple tools to control an infestation, such as physical, biological and chemical measures. Here, we propose that rodent population management would benefit from a new tool aimed at targeting the biological source of overabundance: reproduction. SenesTech, Inc. (Flagstaff, AZ USA) has developed ContraPest\textregistered, a liquid bait that limits the reproductive capacity of both male and female wild Norway and Roof rats. The two active ingredients, 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) and triptolide, deplete all stages of follicles in the female and disrupt spermatogenesis in the male. Laboratory and field studies reveal that ContraPest\textregistered{} is palatable and repeatedly consumed by rats even when provided with ad libitum food and water. Studies involving laboratory and wild caught rats have demonstrated a 93 - 100\% reduction in litter sizes of rats treated with ContraPest\textregistered{} compared to control rats. ContraPest\textregistered{} was tested on free ranging rat populations in agricultural and urban settings. Rat populations on protein production farms decreased by an average of 46\% following 100 days of treatment with ContraPest\textregistered. In a complex urban environment, where property boundaries limit access to populations and foraging areas, ContraPest\textregistered{} reduced the seasonal population peak by 67\% after 133 days of baiting. These studies, combined with all of our field studies and population reduction models, demonstrate that ContraPest\textregistered{} is a highly effective rodent contraceptive bait in a variety of environments. We strongly believe that adding/implementing fertility management via ContraPest\textregistered{} to an IPM program would enhance long-term rodent population control in rural, urban, and agricultural environments.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary biology is a study of life's history on Earth. In researching this history, biologists are often interested in attempting to reconstruct phenotypes for the long extinct ancestors of living species. Various methods have been developed to do this on a phylogeny from the data for extant taxa. In the present article, I introduce a new approach for ancestral character estimation for discretely valued traits. This approach is based on the threshold model from evolutionary quantitative genetics. Under the threshold model, the value exhibited by an individual or species for a discrete character is determined by an underlying, unobserved continuous trait called ``liability.'' In this new method for ancestral state reconstruction, I use Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the liabilities of ancestral and tip species, and the relative positions of two or more thresholds, from their joint posterior probability distribution. Using data simulated under the model, I find that the method has very good performance in ancestral character estimation. Use of the threshold model for ancestral state reconstruction relies on a priori specification of the order of the discrete character states along the liability axis. I test the use of a Bayesian MCMC information theoretic criterion based approach to choose among different hypothesized orderings for the discrete character. Finally, I apply the method to the evolution of feeding mode in centrarchid fishes.},

  abstract = {Objective 1) To synthesize the current observational evidence for the association between sedentary behavior and health outcomes using information from systematic reviews. 2) To assess the methodological quality of the systematic reviews found. Methodology/Principal Findings Medline; Excerpta Medica (Embase); PsycINFO; and Web of Science were searched for reviews published up to September 2013. Additional publications were provided by Sedentary Behaviour Research Network members. The methodological quality of the systematic reviews was evaluated using recommended standard criteria from AMSTAR. For each review, improper use of causal language in the description of their main results/conclusion was evaluated. Altogether, 1,044 review titles were identified, 144 were read in their entirety, and 27 were included. Based on the systematic reviews with the best methodological quality, we found in children and adolescents, strong evidence of a relationship between time spent in sedentary behavior and obesity. Moreover, moderate evidence was observed for blood pressure and total cholesterol, self-esteem, social behavior problems, physical fitness and academic achievement. In adults, we found strong evidence of a relationship between sedentary behavior and all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In addition, there is moderate evidence for incidence rates of ovarian, colon and endometrial cancers. Conclusions This overview based on the best available systematics reviews, shows that sedentary behavior may be an important determinant of health, independently of physical activity. However, the relationship is complex because it depends on the type of sedentary behavior and the age group studied. The relationship between sedentary behavior and many health outcomes remains uncertain; thus, further studies are warranted.},

  abstract = {Clinical evidence indicates that serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT1AR) gene polymorphisms are associated with anxiety disorders and deficits in cognition. In animal models, exercise (Ex) and environmental enrichment (EE) can change emotionality-related behaviours, as well as enhance some aspects of cognition and hippocampal neurogenesis. We investigated the effects of Ex and EE (which does not include running wheels) on cognition and anxiety-like behaviours in wild-type (WT) and 5-HT1AR knock-out (KO) mice. Using an algorithm-based classification of search strategies in the Morris water maze, we report for we believe the first time that Ex increased the odds for mice to select more hippocampal-dependent strategies. In the retention probe test, Ex (but not EE) corrected long-term spatial memory deficits displayed by KO mice. In agreement with these findings, only Ex increased hippocampal cell survival and BDNF protein levels. However, only EE (but not Ex) modified anxiety-like behaviours, demonstrating dissociation between improvements in cognition and innate anxiety. EE enhanced hippocampal cell proliferation in WT mice only, suggesting a crucial role for intact serotonergic signalling in mediating this effect. Together, these results demonstrate differential effects of Ex vs EE in a mouse model of anxiety with cognitive impairment. Overall, the 5-HT1AR does not seem to be critical for those behavioural effects to occur. These findings will have implications for our understanding of how Ex and EE enhance experience-dependent plasticity, as well as their differential impacts on anxiety and cognition.},

The first short presentation concerns the effects of endurance exercise training on cardiovascular fitness, and how it relates to improved health outcomes. The second short section contemplates emerging molecular connections from endurance training to mental health. Finally, approximately half of the remaining review concentrates on the relationships between type 2 diabetes, mitochondria, and endurance training. It is now clear that physical training is complex biology, invoking polygenic interactions within cells, tissues/organs, systems, with remarkable cross talk occurring among the former list.},

ANIMALS: 20 clinically normal male Beagles. PROCEDURE: All dogs were given 8 mg of cholecalciferol (CCF)/kg of body weight once orally, then were assigned randomly to 4 groups of 5 dogs each. Dogs were given 0.9\% NaCl solution IV (group 1), calcitonin SC and 0.9\% NaCl solution IV (group 2), pamidronate and 0.9\% NaCl solution IV (group 3), or a combination of all 3 agents (group 4). Dogs were observed for 28 days, and serial blood and urine samples were collected for determination of serum biochemical, electrolyte, and 25(OH)D3 values, CBC, and urine mineral excretion. Samples of kidney, stomach, lung, aorta, liver, duodenum, and brain were evaluated by light microscopy and quantitative mineral analysis. RESULTS: Two dogs in group 1 were euthanatized 4 days after CCF administration because of severe clinical signs of disease. Dogs in group 3 lost less weight and had significantly lower serum phosphorus, total and ionized calcium, and urinary zinc concentrations, compared with dogs in group 1. On day 4, serum urea nitrogen concentration was significantly lower in dogs of groups 3 and 4, compared with dogs in group 1. Mild to moderate mineralization of kidneys and stomach were observed in the 2 group-1 dogs euthanatized on day 4. CONCLUSIONS: Pamidronate administration effectively prevents CCF-induced hypercalcemia and mineralization of soft tissues. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Pamidronate is a potentially useful antidote against CCF toxicosis in dogs.},

Traps were monitored by motion-activated video cameras at 2 locations where rodents were present. In a 9-week study, 9 traps were baited but not activated, and a blocking device ("blocker") was used in a cross-over design to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing risk to non-target animals. Of 2,282 interactions and 30 species observed, target rodents (Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus; roof rat, Rattus rattus; house mouse, Mus musculus; and deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus) were the most common mammals (532 visits), followed by eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), northern raccoons (Procyon lotor) and shrews (Sorex spp.). Birds were often observed (1,312 visits) but rarely interacted with traps. Raccoons and squirrels entered or inserted limbs in the trap 36 times when no blocker was installed but never when blockers were used. Once we were confident in avoiding non-target strikes, the 9 traps were activated and recorded for 19 wks at 2 locations to evaluate humaneness. Despite 1,532 trap interactions, only 8 kills (3 house mice, 4 deer mice, 1 grey squirrel) occurred with immediate or near-immediate cessation of movement indicating instantaneous death, consistent with post-mortem analysis by micro-CT. One Norway rat and 1 grey squirrel were non-lethally struck by the trap, and 1 deer mouse triggered the trap without obvious injury. The Goodnature\textregistered{} A24 trap appears to be a relatively humane alternative to rodenticide poisons for mice, but further research is needed to evaluate the humaneness and efficacy for rats.},

In this Primer, we outline the principles of MR, the instrumental variable conditions underlying MR estimation and some of the methods used for estimation. We go on to discuss how the assumptions underlying an MR study can be assessed and describe methods of estimation that are robust to certain violations of these assumptions. We give examples of a range of studies in which MR has been applied, the limitations of current methods of analysis and the outlook for MR in the future. The differences between the assumptions required for MR analysis and other forms of epidemiological studies means that MR can be used as part of a triangulation across multiple sources of evidence for causal inference.},

Induced sputum was used to measure cells and eicosanoids. Sputum differential cell counts in all the subject groups revealed eosinophilia with the exception of NAtNAs control subjects. Athletes with and without diagnosed asthma showed a significant increase in bronchial epithelial cells and lymphocytes present in their sputum. Also, flow cytometry revealed that a significantly higher number of basophils were present in sputum from athletes (without and with asthma) when compared with non-athletes (without and with asthma). Asthmatic athletes and non-athletes showed a higher increase in LTC(4) levels and PGE(2) metabolites in sputum when compared with healthy controls.

We present the results of a comparison of the three step selection strategies on the problems in More, Garbow, and Hillstrom in two separate cases: using finite difference gradients and Hessians, and using finite difference gradients with BFGS Hessian approximations. We also describe a second package, REVMIN, that uses optimization algorithms identical to UNCMIN but obtains values of user-supplied functions by reverse communication.},

A series of cases are presented in which the source of abdominal pain was not apparent and was not clarified by physical examination or conventional radiological studies. Computed tomographic (CT) examination of the abdomen provided useful information. The clinician is unlikely to have experience with a spectrum of such cases and the value of CT in hemorrhagic complications of therapy with warfarin sodium.

This product contains two chemicals, both of which impair spermatogenesis in male and reduce ovulations in female rats. We tested the efficacy of this bait in wild-caught adult black rats from the island of Hawai'i in a short-term laboratory trial. A control group (n = 25) was offered placebo bait and the treatment group (n = 25) was offered fertility control bait, both ad libitum, during a 15-day introduction period and during the first of four breeding rounds, for a total of 58 days of exposure. After treatment, all rats were provided placebo bait for the remainder of the study and randomly paired with mates from within their treatment groups for two additional breeding cycles. Treatment and control groups comprised 10 breeding pairs each, with random re-pairings between breeding rounds. The treatment group produced no litters during the first and second breeding rounds, while 70\% of the control females produced litters. In the third breeding round, 70 days after stopping treatment, the treatment group produced three litters (six pups) compared to seven litters (24 pups) in the control group. During a fourth and final breeding round, control rats were crossed with treated rats, producing six litters (27 pups) from treated dams and nine litters (40 pups) from control dams, indicating no apparent infertility effect 99 days after cessation of treatment. This study demonstrates that the reproduction rate of wild-caught black rats can be chemically suppressed if provided ad libitum access to the fertility control bait under laboratory conditions.},

  abstract = {Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is diagnosed by the presence of three categories of behavioural criteria: first, unusual reciprocal social interactions; second, deficits in communication; and third, stereotyped, repetitive behaviours with restricted interests. Behavioural phenotyping of mouse models of autism requires assays that are relevant to each of the three categories of the core symptoms.Optimal animal models incorporate phenotypes that are analogous to the human disease (face validity). They should also incorporate the same cause as the human disease (construct validity), and ameliorative responses that are specific to treatments that are efficacious in the human disease (predictive validity). Robust phenotypes in mouse models of autism that have face validity and construct validity hold great promise as translational tools for discovering effective therapeutics for components of autism spectrum disorders.Mus musculus is a social species that engages in high levels of reciprocal social interactions. Assays for deficits in sociability include the three-chambered social approach test, the partition test, observer-scored parameters of reciprocal social interactions and tests of social transmission of food preference.Communication in mice is not well understood, but assays to investigate this include olfactory discrimination, urinary scent marking and countermarking, and assays of ultrasonic vocalizations in social settings.Assays for repetitive behaviours and restricted interests in mice include measures of motor stereotypies, repetitive self-grooming and perseverative spatial habits in learning tasks that include the T-maze and Morris water maze.Control parameters that assess general health, motor functions and sensory abilities (for example, olfactory detection of pheromones) are essential for ruling out artefacts that could confound the interpretation of social, communication or repetitive phenotypes.},

In Indonesia, villages that practised EBRM had a mean increase in rice yield of 6\%, whereas production levels were maintained in Vietnam but control costs were reduced. In both countries there was a substantial reduction in rodenticide use in villages practising EBRM. These studies provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of EBRM. The findings also highlighted the need to include end-users early in the development of management strategies. Lessons learned from these studies were extrapolated to the development of strategies for rodent management in intensive organic piggeries and poultry holdings in Europe. The challenge for these producers is not only the identification and then integration of different management actions based on our understanding of the ecology of specific rodent species, but also the integration of ecology, sociology and economics.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimation of genetic correlation requires large sample sizes and access to genetically informative data, which are not always available. Accordingly, phenotypic correlations are often assumed to reflect genotypic correlations in evolutionary biology. Cheverud's conjecture asserts that the use of phenotypic correlations as proxies for genetic correlations is appropriate. Empirical evidence of the conjecture has been found across plant and animal species, with results suggesting that there is indeed a robust relationship between the two. Here, we investigate the conjecture in human populations, an analysis made possible by recent developments in availability of human genomic data and computing resources. A sample of 108,035 British European individuals from the UK Biobank was split equally into discovery and replication datasets. Seventeen traits were selected based on sample size, distribution, and heritability. Genetic correlations were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression applied to the genome-wide association summary statistics of pairs of traits, and compared within and across datasets. Strong and significant correlations were found for the between-dataset comparison, suggesting that the genetic correlations from one independent sample were able to predict the phenotypic correlations from another independent sample within the same population. Designating the selected traits as morphological or nonmorphological indicated little difference in correlation. The results of this study support the existence of a relationship between genetic and phenotypic correlations in humans. This finding is of specific interest in anthropological studies, which use measured phenotypic correlations to make inferences about the genetics of ancient human populations.},

To characterize asthmatic features, the following parameters were analyzed: (i) differential cell counts and cytokine expression in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); (ii) presence of mucus-producing goblet cells and pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs; (iii) serum immunoglobulin levels; and (iv) airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). RNA-Seq and bioinformatics tools were used to investigate whether PHMG-P altered asthma-related gene expression in lung tissues. The PHMG-P exposure groups showed higher peribronchial/perivascular inflammation, elevated goblet cell hyperplasia, and inhaled methacholine-induced airway resistance. Additionally, IL-13 and IL-17 in BALF were significantly increased in the PHMG-P exposure groups. However, there were no significant differences in total serum IgE and BALF IL-4 and IL-5 levels in the PHMG-P exposure groups compared to the control group. PHMG-P exposure modulated the expression of genes related to Th17 signaling pathways including the IL-17A, IL-23, and STAT3 signaling pathways, but not the Th2 signaling pathway. Altogether, our results suggest that repeated exposure to low does PHMG-P induces asthma-like symptoms and is thus a possible risk factor for developing asthma. The PHMG-P-induced asthmatic airway inflammation showed a different pattern from that found in typical allergic asthma and may be related to irritant-induced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness characterized by Th2-low, Th17-related, IgE-independent, and mixed granulocytic features.},

In humans, the orbitofrontal cortex is active during expressions of regret, and humans with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex do not express regret. In rats and nonhuman primates, both the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum have been implicated in reward computations. We recorded neural ensembles from orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum in rats encountering wait or skip choices for delayed delivery of different flavors using an economic framework. Economically, encountering a high-cost choice after skipping a low-cost choice should induce regret. In these situations, rats looked backwards toward the lost option, cells within orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum represented the missed action, rats were more likely to wait for the long delay, and rats rushed through eating the food after that delay.},

Procedures involved: a three-day acceptance test to assess vole consumption (n = 27) of control SRO groats and several one-day Zn3P2- (n = 13) or control-bait (n = 4) tests to characterize onset of pharmacotoxic signs and to obtain fatally-dosed carcasses for residue analyses. Carcasses were stored in liquid nitrogen (LN2) to maximize retention of Zn3P2/PH3 residues prior to chemical determinations. Linear regressions were computed between pairs of consumption and residue variables. Main results were the following: (1) mean (+/- SD) consumption of control bait was 2.5 (+/- 0.9), 3.0 (+/- 0.9), and 2.8 (+/- 0.8) g on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively ({$>$} or = 10.6 +/- 4.6\% of body weight); (2) all test-bait voles (n = 13) died approximately 4-12 h after bait presentation, with lethargy and respiratory distress key signs of toxicosis; (3) whole-carcass Zn3P2 residues averaged 1.73 mg (min-max: 0.31-4.95), and PH3 residues averaged 10.6 micrograms (min-max: 0.5-21.0); and (4) significant linear regressions were found between bait consumption/Zn3P2 intake and body weight (r2 = 0.64, p {$<$} or = 0.001), carcass Zn3P2 and bait consumption/Zn3P2 intake (r2 = 0.32, p {$<$} or = 0.043), and carcass Zn3P2 and body weight (r2 = 0.60, p {$<$} or = 0.002).

Both human and nonhuman animals can show sensitivity to sunk costs, but reports from across species are inconsistent. In a temporal context, a sensitivity to sunk costs arises when an individual resists ending an activity, even if it seems unproductive, because of the time already invested. In two parallel foraging tasks that we designed, we found that mice, rats, and humans show similar sensitivities to sunk costs in their decision-making. Unexpectedly, sensitivity to time invested accrued only after an initial decision had been made. These findings suggest that sensitivity to temporal sunk costs lies in a vulnerability distinct from deliberation processes and that this distinction is present across species.},

The dog displayed clinical signs of severe depression, anorexia and intermittent vomiting during this time interval. Serum calcium levels rose on day 6 and remained elevated up until the dog was euthanized on day 9. Gross and histopathological examinations revealed diffuse metastatic mineralization throughout the body, particularly involving the lung, kidney, atria and stomach. The amount of cholecalciferol ingested was determined well below the lethal dose reported in dogs. This report indicates that young dogs may be much more susceptible to the lethal effects of this compound than initially believed.},

We tested the ability of nine Long-Evans rats to distinguish between remembering and forgetting by presenting a decline option that allowed a four-choice odor-based delayed match to sample (DMTS) tests to be by-passed. Rats performed significantly better on tests they chose to take than on tests they were forced to take, indicating metacognitive responding. However, rather than control by internal mnemonic cues, one alternative explanation is that decline use is based on external test-specific cues that become associated with increased rewards overtime. To examine this possibility, we tested rats on three generalization tests in which external contingencies were inconsistent and therefore could not serve as discriminative cues. Rats transferred adaptive use of the decline response in tests that eliminated memory by presenting no sample, increased memory by presenting multiple samples, and both weakened and strengthened memory by varying the retention interval. Further, subjects chose to take or decline the test before encountering the memory test, providing evidence that rats based their metacognitive responding on internal cues rather than external ones. To our knowledge, this is the first robust evidence for metamemory in rats using the DMTS decline-test paradigm in which several possible sources of external stimulus control can be ruled out.},

Anticoagulant rodenticides inhibit the enzyme vitamin K-dependent carboxylase and thus impair the reactivation of vitamin K1, indirectly affecting physiological blood coagulation. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical signs (massive hemorrhages), laboratory findings, and especially the changes in coagulation markers (APTT, PT, TT, PCT, ACT, FDPs, and PIVKA). The specific antidote is vitamin K1. The general prophylaxis consists of placing baits out of reach of animals, daily control of baits and dead rodents, which are to be timely removed.},

Traditional R\textasciicircum{} will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

  abstract = {Although the etiology and expression of psychiatric disorders are complex, mammals show biologically preserved behavioral and neurobiological responses to valent stimuli which underlie the use of rodent models of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a complex phenotype that is difficult to model in rodents because it is diagnosed by patient interview and influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. However, given that PTSD results from traumatic experiences, rodent models can simulate stress induction and disorder development. By manipulating stress type, intensity, duration, and frequency, preclinical models reflect core PTSD phenotypes, measured through various behavioral assays. Paradigms precipitate the disorder by applying physical, social, and psychological stressors individually or in combination. This review discusses the methods used to trigger and evaluate PTSD-like phenotypes. It highlights studies employing each stress model and evaluates their translational efficacies against DSM-5, validity criteria, and criteria proposed by Yehuda and Antelman's commentary in 1993. This is intended to aid in paradigm selection by informing readers about rodent models, their benefits to the clinical community, challenges associated with the translational models, and opportunities for future work. To inform PTSD model validity and relevance to human psychopathology, we propose that models incorporate behavioral test batteries, individual differences, sex differences, strain and stock differences, early life stress effects, biomarkers, stringent success criteria for drug development, Research Domain Criteria, technological advances, and cross-species comparisons. We conclude that, despite the challenges, animal studies will be pivotal to advances in understanding PTSD and the neurobiology of stress.},

  abstract = {Generalization from previous experiences to new situations is a hallmark of intelligent behavior and a prerequisite for category learning. It has been proposed that category learning in humans relies on multiple brain systems that compete with each other, including an explicit, rule-based system and an implicit system. Given that humans are biased to follow rule-based strategies, a counterintuitive prediction of this model is that other animals, in which this rule-based system is less developed, might generalize better to new stimuli in implicit category-learning tasks that are not rule-based. To test this prediction, rats and humans were trained in rule-based and information-integration category-learning tasks with visual stimuli. The generalization performance of rats and humans was equal in rule-based categorization, but rats outperformed humans on generalization in the information-integration task. The performance of rats was consistent with a nondimensional, similarity-based categorization strategy. These findings illustrate through a comparative approach that the bias toward rule-based strategies can impede humans' performance on generalization tasks.},

  abstract = {The ownership of one's body parts represents a fundamental aspect of self-consciousness. Accumulating empirical evidence supports the existence of this concept in humans and nonhuman primates, but it is unclear whether nonprimate mammals experience similar feelings. Therefore, the present study used rubber tails to investigate body ownership in rodents. When the real tails and rubber tails were synchronously stroked, the mice responded as if their own tails were touched when the rubber tails were grasped. In contrast, when the stimuli were delivered asynchronously, there was a significantly lower mean response rate when the rubber tail was grasped. These findings suggest that mice may experience body ownership of their tails, suggestive of the rubber hand illusion in humans. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT To explore the manner in which the ownership of body parts is experienced, this study specifically used the rubber hand illusion (RHI), in which self-consciousness can be extended out of one's own body. Accumulating empirical evidence supports the existence of this concept in humans and nonhuman primates, but it remains unclear whether nonprimate mammals experience similar feelings. This study demonstrated for the first time that mice may experience body ownership of their tails, which is suggestive of the RHI in humans and provides evidence that may highlight how humans experience the ownership of body parts.},

Combining data for up to 703,901 individuals from 51 studies in a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies yields 99 loci that associate with self-reported moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity during leisure time (MVPA), leisure screen time (LST) and/or sedentary behavior at work. Loci associated with LST are enriched for genes whose expression in skeletal muscle is altered by resistance training. A missense variant in ACTN3 makes the alpha-actinin-3 filaments more flexible, resulting in lower maximal force in isolated type IIA muscle fibers, and possibly protection from exercise-induced muscle damage. Finally, Mendelian randomization analyses show that beneficial effects of lower LST and higher MVPA on several risk factors and diseases are mediated or confounded by body mass index (BMI). Our results provide insights into physical activity mechanisms and its role in disease prevention.},

  abstract = {Humans have a sense of fairness and consequently are averse to inequality conditions. Recently, animal researchers suggested that some non-human animals also have inequality aversion. The author used stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) to examine inequality aversion in mice. Experiment 1 measured the change in body surface temperature of mice under the condition of equality or inequality of food delivery. The results demonstrated that mice exhibited a large increment in body surface temperature when given a small piece of cheese and a cage mate was given a large piece. There was no increment in body temperature in equality conditions in which both the subject and the cage mate were given the same amount of cheese. The increase in body temperature was considered stress-induced hyperthermia caused by social inequality aversion. This is the first demonstration of inequality aversion of food delivery in mice. Simultaneous presentation of a large piece of cheese and a cage mate resulted in SIH in observer mice that were given a small piece of cheese, even though the cage mate was separated from the cheese by a partition to prevent it from eating the cheese. In Experiment 2, behavioral effects of inequality were examined in a chamber with two compartments. Mice could observe a cage mate in an adjacent compartment. They preferred a compartment with a cheese-eating cage mate to a compartment with cheese alone or cage mate alone. This result suggests inequality preference rather than inequality aversion. Thus, the results of Experiments 1 and 2 were contradictory. In a subsequent Experiment 3, both behavioral preference and body surface temperature were measured simultaneously. Mice stayed longer in the inequality condition compartment (cheese-eating cage mate), although inequality caused SIH. Supporting the results of both Experiments 1 and 2. Thus, social inequality induced stress (aversive property) but it also induced approaching behavior that might be maintained by the informative value of a food-eating cage mate.},

But how do Neandertals and modern humans compare with other species? And how do these comparisons illuminate the evolutionary processes underlying cranial diversification? To address these questions, we used 27 standard cranial measurements collected on 2524 recent modern humans, 20 Neandertals and 237 common chimpanzees to estimate split times between Neandertals and modern humans, and between Pan troglodytes verus and two other subspecies of common chimpanzee. Consistent with a neutral divergence, the Neandertal versus modern human split-time estimates based on cranial measurements are similar to those based on DNA sequences. By contrast, the common chimpanzee cranial estimates are much lower than DNA-sequence estimates. Apparently, cranial evolution has been unconstrained in Neandertals and modern humans compared with common chimpanzees. Based on these and additional analyses, it appears that cranial differentiation in common chimpanzees has been restricted by stabilizing natural selection. Alternatively, this restriction could be due to genetic and/or developmental constraints on the amount of within-group variance (relative to effective population size) available for genetic drift to act on.}

  abstract = {Trauma is the leading cause of mortality in humans below the age of 40. Patients injured by accidents frequently suffer severe multiple trauma, which is life-threatening and leads to death in many cases. In multiply injured patients, thoracic trauma constitutes the third most common cause of mortality after abdominal injury and head trauma. Furthermore, 40\textendash 50\% of all trauma-related deaths within the first 48~h after hospital admission result from uncontrolled hemorrhage. Physical trauma and hemorrhage are frequently associated with complex pathophysiological and immunological responses. To develop a greater understanding of the mechanisms of single and/or multiple trauma, reliable and reproducible animal models, fulfilling the ethical 3 R's criteria (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement), established by Russell and Burch in `The Principles of Human Experimental Technique' (published 1959), are required. These should reflect both the complex pathophysiological and the immunological alterations induced by trauma, with the objective to translate the findings to the human situation, providing new clinical treatment approaches for patients affected by severe trauma. Small animal models are the most frequently used in trauma research. Rattus norvegicus was the first mammalian species domesticated for scientific research, dating back to 1830. To date, there exist numerous well-established procedures to mimic different forms of injury patterns in rats, animals that are uncomplicated in handling and housing. Nevertheless, there are some physiological and genetic differences between humans and rats, which should be carefully considered when rats are chosen as a model organism. The aim of this review is to illustrate the advantages as well as the disadvantages of rat models, which should be considered in trauma research when selecting an appropriate in vivo model. Being the most common and important models in trauma research, this review focuses on hemorrhagic shock, blunt chest trauma, bone fracture, skin and soft-tissue trauma, burns, traumatic brain injury and polytrauma.},

  abstract = {The multispecies coalescent (MSC) is a statistical framework that models how gene genealogies grow within the branches of a species tree. The field of computational phylogenetics has witnessed an explosion in the development of methods for species tree inference under MSC, owing mainly to the accumulating evidence of incomplete lineage sorting in phylogenomic analyses. However, the evolutionary history of a set of genomes, or species, could be reticulate due to the occurrence of evolutionary processes such as hybridization or horizontal gene transfer. We report on a novel method for Bayesian inference of genome and species phylogenies under the multispecies network coalescent (MSNC). This framework models gene evolution within the branches of a phylogenetic network, thus incorporating reticulate evolutionary processes, such as hybridization, in addition to incomplete lineage sorting. As phylogenetic networks with different numbers of reticulation events correspond to points of different dimensions in the space of models, we devise a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) technique for sampling the posterior distribution of phylogenetic networks under MSNC. We implemented the methods in the publicly available, open-source software package PhyloNet and studied their performance on simulated and biological data. The work extends the reach of Bayesian inference to phylogenetic networks and enables new evolutionary analyses that account for reticulation.}

  abstract = {The multispecies network coalescent (MSNC) is a stochastic process that captures how gene trees grow within the branches of a phylogenetic network. Coupling the MSNC with a stochastic mutational process that operates along the branches of the gene trees gives rise to a generative model of how multiple loci from within and across species evolve in the presence of both incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and reticulation (e.g., hybridization). We report on a Bayesian method for sampling the parameters of this generative model, including the species phylogeny, gene trees, divergence times, and population sizes, from DNA sequences of multiple independent loci. We demonstrate the utility of our method by analyzing simulated data and reanalyzing an empirical data set. Our results demonstrate the significance of not only coestimating species phylogenies and gene trees, but also accounting for reticulation and ILS simultaneously. In particular, we show that when gene flow occurs, our method accurately estimates the evolutionary histories, coalescence times, and divergence times. Tree inference methods, on the other hand, underestimate divergence times and overestimate coalescence times when the evolutionary history is reticulate. While the MSNC corresponds to an abstract model of ``intermixture,'' we study the performance of the model and method on simulated data generated under a gene flow model. We show that the method accurately infers the most recent time at which gene flow occurs. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the new method to a 106-locus yeast data set.}

  abstract = {For most complex traits, gene regulation is known to play a crucial mechanistic role as demonstrated by the consistent enrichment of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) among trait-associated variants. Thus, understanding the genetic architecture of gene expression traits is key to elucidating the underlying mechanisms of complex traits. However, a systematic survey of the heritability and the distribution of effect sizes across all representative tissues in the human body has not been reported. Here we fill this gap through analyses of the RNA-seq data from a comprehensive set of tissue samples generated by the GTEx Project and the DGN whole blood cohort. We find that local h2 can be relatively well characterized with 50\% of expressed genes showing significant h2 in DGN and 8-19\% in GTEx. However, the current sample sizes (n {$<$} 362 in GTEx) only allow us to compute distal h2 for a handful of genes (3\% in DGN and {$<$}1\% in GTEx). Thus, we focus on local regulation. Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model (BSLMM) analysis and the sparsity of optimal performing predictors provide compelling evidence that local architecture of gene expression traits is sparse rather than polygenic across DGN and all 40 GTEx tissues examined. To further delve into the tissue context specificity, we decompose the expression traits into cross-tissue and tissue-specific components. Heritability and sparsity estimates of these derived expression phenotypes show similar characteristics to the original traits. Consistent properties relative to prior GTEx multi-tissue analysis results suggest that these traits reflect the expected biology. Finally, we apply this knowledge to develop prediction models of gene expression traits for all tissues. The prediction models, heritability, and prediction performance R2 for original and decomposed expression phenotypes are made publicly available (https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan). Author Summary Gene regulation is known to contribute to the underlying mechanisms of complex traits. The GTEx project has generated RNA-Seq data on hundreds of individuals across more than 40 tissues providing a comprehensive atlas of gene expression traits. Here, we systematically examined the local versus distant heritability as well as the sparsity versus polygenicity of protein coding gene expression traits in tissues across the entire human body. To determine tissue context specificity, we decomposed the expression levels into cross-tissue and tissue-specific components. Regardless of tissue type, we found that local heritability can be well characterized with current sample sizes. Unless strong functional priors and large sample sizes are used, the heritability due to distant variants cannot be estimated. We also find that the distribution of effect sizes is more consistent with a sparse architecture across all tissues. We also show that the cross-tissue and tissue-specific expression phenotypes constructed with our orthogonal tissue decomposition model recapitulate complex Bayesian multi-tissue analysis results. This knowledge was applied to develop prediction models of gene expression traits for all tissues, which we make publicly available.},

  abstract = {Many aspects of morphological phylogenetics are controversial in the theoretical systematics literature and yet are often poorly explained and justified in empirical studies. In this paper, I argue that most morphological characters describe variation that is fundamentally quantitative, regardless of whether they are coded qualitatively or quantitatively by systematists. Given this view, three fundamental problems in morphological character analysis (definition, delimitation, and ordering of character states) may have a common solution: coding morphological characters as continuous quantitative traits. A new parsimony method (step-matrix gap-weighting, a modification of Thiele's approach) is proposed that allows quantitative traits to be analyzed as continuous variables. The problem of scaling or weighting quantitative characters relative to qualitative characters (and to each other) is reviewed, and three possible solutions are described. The new coding method is applied to data from hoplocercid lizards, and the results show the sensitivity of phylogenetic conclusions to different scaling methods. Although some authors reject the use of continuous, overlapping, quantitative characters in phylogenetic analysis, quantitative data from hoplocercid lizards that are coded using the new approach contain significant phylogenetic structure and exhibit levels of homoplasy similar to those seen in data that are coded qualitatively.}

However, it has been known for decades that there are regions of solution space in which parsimony is a poor estimator of tree topology. Numerous software implementations of likelihood-based models for the estimation of phylogeny from discrete morphological data exist, especially for the Mk model of discrete character evolution. Here we explore the efficacy of Bayesian estimation of phylogeny, using the Mk model, under conditions that are commonly encountered in paleontological studies. Using simulated data, we describe the relative performances of parsimony and the Mk model under a range of realistic conditions that include common scenarios of missing data and rate heterogeneity.}

Like any model, the Mk model makes a number of assumptions. One assumption is that transitions between character states are symmetric (i.e., the probability of changing from 0 to 1 is the same as 1 to 0). However, some characters in a data matrix may not satisfy this assumption. Here, we test methods for relaxing this assumption in a Bayesian context. Using empirical data sets, we perform model fitting to illustrate cases in which modeling asymmetric transition rates among characters is preferable to the standard Mk model. We use simulated data sets to demonstrate that choosing the best-fit model of transition-state symmetry can improve model fit and phylogenetic estimation.}

  abstract = {Running exercise has been shown to relieve symptoms of depression, but the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects are unclear. Microglia and concomitant dysregulated neuroinflammation play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of depression. However, the effects of running exercise on hippocampal neuroinflammation and the number and activation of microglia in depression have not been studied. In this study, rats were subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 5 weeks followed by treadmill running for 6 weeks. The depressive-like symptoms of the rats were assessed with a sucrose preference test (SPT). Immunohistochemistry and stereology were performed to quantify the total number of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1)+ microglia, and immunofluorescence was used to quantify the density of Iba1+/cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68)+ in subregions of the hippocampus. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. The results showed that running exercise reversed the decreased sucrose preference of rats with CUS-induced depression. In addition, CUS increased the number of hippocampal microglia and microglial activation in rats, but running exercise attenuated the CUS-induced increases in the number of microglia in the hippocampus and microglial activation in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Furthermore, CUS significantly increased the hippocampal levels of inflammatory factors, and the increases in inflammatory factors in the hippocampus were suppressed by running exercise. These results suggest that the antidepressant effects of exercise may be mediated by reducing the number of microglia and inhibiting microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus.},

Here, we quantify the relative contributions of genetics and aging to gene expression patterns across 27 tissues from 948 humans. We show that the predictive power of expression quantitative trait loci is impacted by age in many tissues. Jointly modelling the contributions of age and genetics to transcript level variation we find expression heritability (h2) is consistent among tissues while the contribution of aging varies by {$>$}20-fold with \$\$\{R\}\_\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\textbackslash rm\{age\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\^\{2\} \textbackslash; {$>$} \textbackslash;\{h\}\^\{2\}\$\$in 5 tissues. We find that while the force of purifying selection is stronger on genes expressed early versus late in life (Medawar's hypothesis), several highly proliferative tissues exhibit the opposite pattern. These non-Medawarian tissues exhibit high rates of cancer and age-of-expression-associated somatic mutations. In contrast, genes under genetic control are under relaxed constraint. Together, we demonstrate the distinct roles of aging and genetics on expression phenotypes.},

We show that 45\% of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.},

GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

We applied MESC to GWAS summary statistics for 42 traits (average N\,=\,323,000) and cis-eQTL summary statistics for 48 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. Averaging across traits, only 11\,{$\pm$}\,2\% of heritability was mediated by assayed gene expression levels. Expression-mediated heritability was enriched in genes with evidence of selective constraint and genes with disease-appropriate annotations. Our results demonstrate that assayed bulk tissue eQTLs, although disease relevant, cannot explain the majority of disease heritability.},

Specifically, the distinct effects of developmental and functional integration on the evolution of complex traits are often overlooked. Because patterns of functional integration are commonly shaped by selection exerted by the external environment, whereas patterns of developmental integration can be determined by relatively environment-independent selection for developmental homeostasis, examination of historical persistence of morphological integration patterns among species should reveal the relative importance of current selection in the evolution of complex traits. We compared historical persistence of integration patterns produced by current developmental versus ecological requirements by examining the evolution of complex mandibular structures in nine species of soricid shrews. We found that, irrespective of phylogenetic relatedness of species, patterns of developmental and functional integration were highly concordant, suggesting that strong selection for developmental homeostasis favors concordant channeling of both internal and external variation. Overall, our results suggest that divergence in mandible shape among species closely follows variation in functional demands and ecological requirements regardless of phylogenetic relatedness among species.},

  abstract = {Background Clinical and epidemiologic studies have shown that obesity is associated with asthma and that these associations differ by asthma subtype. Little is known about the shared genetic components between obesity and asthma. Objective We sought to identify shared genetic associations between obesity-related traits and asthma subtypes in adults. Methods A cross-trait genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using 457,822 subjects of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. Experimental evidence to support the role of genes significantly associated with both obesity-related traits and asthma through a GWAS was sought by using results from obese versus lean mouse RNA sequencing and RT-PCR experiments. Results We found a substantial positive genetic correlation between body mass index and later-onset asthma defined by asthma age of onset at 16 years or greater (Rg~= 0.25, P~= 9.56~\texttimes ~10-22). Mendelian randomization analysis provided strong evidence in support of body mass index causally increasing asthma risk. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 34 shared loci among 3 obesity-related traits and 2 asthma subtypes. GWAS functional analyses identified potential causal relationships between the shared loci and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) quantitative trait loci and shared immune- and cell differentiation\textendash related pathways between obesity and asthma. Finally, RNA sequencing data from lungs of obese versus control mice found that 2 genes (acyl-coenzyme A~oxidase-like [ACOXL] and myosin light chain 6 [MYL6]) from the cross-trait meta-analysis were differentially expressed, and these findings were validated by using RT-PCR in an independent set of mice. Conclusions Our work identified shared genetic components between obesity-related traits and specific asthma subtypes, reinforcing the hypothesis that obesity causally increases the risk of asthma and identifying molecular pathways that might underlie both obesity and asthma.},
